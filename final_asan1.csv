0,ABDOMINAL BREATHING,": Lie in shavasana and relax the whole body. Maintain unbroken awareness of the natural breath for some time, concentrating on the sides of the chest. Perform thoracic breathing for a few minutes. Inhale, fully expanding the ribcage. When the ribs are fully expanded, inhale a little more until expansion is felt in the upper portion of the lungs around the base of the neck. The shoulders and collar bone should also move up slightly. This will take some effort. Exhale slowly, first releasing the lower neck and upper chest, then relaxing the rest of the ribcage back to its starting position. Continue for a few more breaths, observing the effect of this type of breathing. Relax any effort and once again watch the spontaneous breathing pattern. Bring the awareness back to observing the physical body as a whole. Be aware of the surroundings and gently open the eyes.  382 YOGIC BREATHING  Yogic breathing combines the previous three techniques. It is used to maximize inhalation and exhalation. Its purpose is to gain control of the breath, correct poor breathing habits and increase oxygen intake.  It may be practised at any time and is especially useful in situations of high stress or anger for calming the nerves. However, while its inclusion in a daily yoga program will correct and deepen natural breathing patterns, yogic breathing itself should not be performed continually.  Yogic breathing Sit in a meditation posture or lie in shavasana and relax the whole body. Inhale slowly and deeply, allowing the abdomen to expand fully. Try to breathe so slowly that little or no sound of the breath can be heard. Feel the air reaching into the bottom of the lungs. At the end of abdominal expansion, start to expand the chest outward and upward. When the ribs are fully expanded, inhale a little more until expansion is felt in the upper portion of the lungs around the base of the neck. The shoulders and collar bone should also move up slightly. Some tension will be felt in the neck muscles. The rest of the body should be relaxed. Feel the air filling the upper lobes of the lungs. This completes one inhalation. The whole process should be one continuous movement, each phase of breathing merging into the next without any obvious transition point. There should be no jerks or unnecessary strain. The breathing should be like the swell of the sea. Now start to exhale.  383 First, relax the lower neck and upper chest, then allow the chest to contract downward and then inward.  Next, allow the diaphragm to push upward and toward the chest.  Without straining, try to empty the lungs as much as possible by drawing or pulling the abdominal wall as near as possible to the spine.  The entire movement should be harmonious and flowing. Hold the breath for a few seconds at the end of exhalation. This completes one round of yogic breathing.  At first perform 5 to 10 rounds and slowly increase to 10 minutes daily.  Relax any effort and once again watch the spontaneous breathing pattern.  Bring the awareness back to observing the physical body as a whole. Be aware of the surroundings and gently open the eyes.  Practice  note: The main requirement in pranayama is that respiration be comfortable and relaxed. Consequently, once awareness and control of the breathing process has been established, the clavicular technique is dropped and yogic breathing is modified to become a combination of abdominal and thoracic breathing. The breath should flow naturally and not be forced.  384    NADI SHODHANA PRANAYAMA  AS)  BSY ©  Hand note: Both nostrils must be clear and flowing freely. Mucous blockages may be removed through the practice of neti (see the section Shatkarma). If the flow of breath in the nostrils is unequal, it may be balanced by practising padadhirasana as a breath balancing technique (see Vajrasana Group of Asanas).  Beginners should be familiar with abdominal breathing before taking up nadi shodhana.  Technique note: Development of nadi shodhana is intended to take place over a long period of time. Each technique should be practised until perfected. Developing the ratios and counts in each technique may take many years.  Each time the ratio is changed, start with a low count and build up gradually without strain. Practise a given ratio until perfected. The length of the breath should increase spontaneously without the use of force.  The point is not how long the breath can be held, but rather to give the mind, body and lifestyle time to adapt to psychic and physical repercussions.  Techniques 1 and 2 prepare the lungs and the nervous system for techniques 3 and 4, which introduce antar and bahir kumbhaka (internal and external breath retention). Mastery of the techniques should take time as the body and mind need to adjust to the effects of extended breath retention. The full benefits of this practice will be obtained by systematically perfecting each level, rather than by struggling prematurely with the advanced techniques.  It is important to experience each stage fully and become established in that new pattern of breath and its effects on the nervous system, energy levels, emotions, mental clarity and subtle aspects of the personality.  note: About one-third of the populationis genetically unable to roll the sides of the tongue into a tube. However, the practice of sheetkari pranayama gives similar benefits.   position: Nasagra Mudra (nosetip position) Hold the fingers of the right hand in front of the face. Rest the index and middle fingers gently on the eyebrow centre. Both fingers should be relaxed. The thumb is above the right nostril and the ring finger above the left. These two digits control the flow of breath in the nostrils by alternately pressing on one nostril, blocking the flow of breath, and then the other. The little finger is comfortably folded. When practising for long periods, the elbow may be supported in the palm of the left hand, although care is needed to prevent chest restriction.  Nadi Shodhana Pranayama (psychic network purification) Technique  |: Preparatory practice Stage |: Begin with equal inhalation and exhalation, using the ratio 1:1.  Close the right nostril with the thumb and inhale through the left nostril.  At the same time count mentally, “1, Om; 2, Om; 3, Om”, until the inhalation ends comfortably. This is the basic count.  Breathe deeply without strain.  Close the left nostril with the ring finger and release the pressure of the thumb on the right nostril. While exhaling through the right nostril, simultaneously count, “1, Om; 2, Om; 3, Om”. The time for inhalation and exhalation should be equal.  Next, inhale through the right nostril, keeping the same count in the same manner.  At the end of inhalation, close the right nostril and open the left nostril. Exhale through the left nostril, counting as before.  This is one round.  Practise 5 tol0 rounds.  |: Begin with equal inhalation, inner retention and exhalation, using the ratio 1:1:1.  Close the right nostril and inhale slowly through the left nostril for a count of 5.  Atthe end of inhalation, close both nostrils and retain the air in the lungs for a count of 5.  Open the right nostril and exhale for a count of 5.  At the end of exhalation, inhale through the right nostril for a count of 5, keeping the left nostril closed.  Again, retain the breath for a count of 5 with both nostrils closed.  Open the left nostril and exhale for a count of 5.  This is one round using the ratio 5:5:5.  Maintain constant awareness of the count and of the breath. Practise up to 10 rounds.  |: Begin with the ratio 1:1:1:1 and a count such as 5:5:5:5.  Inhale through the left nostril, counting to 5.  Retain the breath in antar kumbhaka, counting to 5. Exhale through the right nostril, counting to 5.  After exhalation, close both nostrils and hold the breath outside, counting to 5.  The glottis may be slightly contracted to hold the air outside. Exhale slightly through the right nostril im- mediately before inhaling. This will release the lock on the lungs and the glottis and bring the respiratory system smoothly back into operation.  Inhale slowly through the right nostril, counting to 5. Retain the breath, counting to 5.  Exhale through the left nostril, counting to 5.  Again, hold the breath outside, counting to 5 with both nostrils closed. If necessary, exhale slightly through the right nostril before breathing in at the start of the next round. This is one round.  Practise 5 rounds.   I: Sit in any comfortable meditation posture, preferably siddha/siddha yoni asana or padmasana. Keep the head and spine upright. Relax the whole body and close the eyes. Practise yogic breathing for some time. Adopt nasagra mudra with the right hand and place the left hand on the knee in chin or jnana mudra.  385 Close the right nostril with the thumb.  Inhale and exhale through the left nostril 5 times.  The rate of inhalation/exhalation should be normal.  Be aware of each breath.  After completing 5 breaths, release the pressure of the thumb on the right nostril and press the left nostril with the ring finger, blocking the flow of air.  Inhale and exhale through theright nostril 5 times, keeping the respiration rate normal.  Lower the hand and breathe 5 times through both nostrils together.  This is one round.  Practise 5 rounds or for 3 to 5 minutes, making sure that there is no sound as the air passes through the nostrils. Practise until this stage is mastered before commencing the next stage.  Stage  2: Begin to control the duration of each breath.  Count the length of the inhalation and exhalation through the left, right and both nostrils. Breathe deeply without strain.  While inhaling, count mentally, “1, Om; 2, Om; 3, Om”, until the inhalation ends comfortably.  While exhaling, simultaneously count, “1, Om; 2, Om; 3, Om”. Inhalation and exhalation should be equal. Practise 5 rounds or for 3 to 5 minutes, making sure that there is no sound as the air passes through the nostrils.  2: Alternate nostril breathing In this technique the basic pattern of alternate nostril breathing is established.  Stage 2: After perfecting the above 1:1 ratio, it may be changed to 1:2.  Initially halve the length of the inhalation. Inhale for a count of 5 and exhale for a count of 10.  Repeat on the other side.  This is one round.  Practise 5 tol0 rounds.  2: After perfecting the ratio of 1:1:1, increase the ratio to 1:1:2. Initially use a short count. Inhale for a count of 5, perform internal kumbhaka for a count of 5 and exhale for a count of 10.  2: The next ratio is 1:1:2:1. It should be commenced with a low count and extended gradually as previously  instructed. Begin with 5:5:10:5.  392 2: with Antar Kumbhaka (internal retention)  At the end of inhalation, retain the breath inside for one or two seconds at first. The duration may be gradually increased as the technique is mastered.  Advanced  Extension: Notice that the length of the breath will spon- taneously increase after some days of practice.  When the count reaches 10 without any strain, go on to technique 2.  Extension: After one week, if there is no difficulty, increase the length of inhalation/exhalation by one count. Continue to increase the count in this way until the count of 10:10 is reached.  387 Do not force the breath in any way. Be careful not to speed up the counting during exhalation to compensate for shortage of breath. Reduce the count at the slightest sign of discomfort.  Stage Extension: During the ensuing months of practice, continue extending the breath by adding one count to the inhalation and two to the exhalation, up to the count of Extension: After becoming comfortable with the count of 5:5:5, the breath and kumbhaka can be lengthened. Gradually increase the count by adding | unit to the inhalation, 1 unit to the retention and 1 unit to the exhalation. The count of one round will then be 6:6:6.  When this has been perfected and there is no discomfort, increase the count to 7:7:7.  Continue in this way until the count of 10:10:10is reached. Do not force the breath. At the slightest sign of strain reduce the count.  Stage Extension: After mastering the count of 5:5:10, gradually increase the count by adding | unit to the inhalation, 1 unit to the retention and 2 units to the exhalation. The count of one round will then be 6:6:12. When this has been perfected and there is no discomfort, increase the count to  389 7:7:14, Gradually increase the count over several months of practice until the count of 10:10:20 is reached.  Stage Extension: When this has been perfected, the count can be gradually increased by adding 1 unit to the inhalation, 2 units to the retention and 2 units to the exhalation. The count of one round will then be 6:12:12. In this manner, gradually increase the count to 10:20:20.  Stage Extension: When this has been perfected and there is no discomfort, the count can be gradually increased by adding 1 unit to the inhalation, 3 units to the retention and 2 units to the exhalation. The count of one round will then be 6:18:12. In this manner, gradually increase the count to 10:30:20.  Stage Extension: Add 1 unit to the inhalation, 4 units to the retention and 2 units to the exhalation. The count of one round will then be 6:24:12. In this manner, gradually increase the count to 10:40:20.  Extension: Once the bandha can be held without strain, gradually build up the count. Jalandhara and moola Extension: When the bandhas can be held without strain, gradually build up the count and then the ratio. Extension: When the ratio has been perfected at this count, gradually increase by adding 1 unit to the inhalation, internal retention, exhalation and external retention. The count should slowly be increased from 5 to 6, 6 to 7 and so on, until the count of 10:10:10:10 is reached.  Do not increase the count for inhalation until the counts for exhalation and breath retentions are comfortable. Stage Extension: Once the ratio has been established, the count can be gradually increased. Add one unit to the inhalation, one unit to the internal retention, 2 units to the exhalation and one unit to the external retention. The count for one round would thus become 6:6:12:6. Over time, the count can be slowly increased. Do not increase the count for inhalation until the relative counts for exhalation and breath retentions are comfortable.  Stage  10: 20. When this technique can be performed with complete ease, move on to technique 3.   3: with Antar Kumbhaka (inner retention)  In this technique antar kumbhaka or internal breath retention is introduced. The inhalation and exhalation should be silent, smooth and controlled.  Stage 3: Change the ratio to 1:2:2. Inhale for a count of 5, do internal kumbhaka for a count of 10 and exhale for a count of 10. Practise until the ratio is comfortable and there is no tendency to speedup the count during retention or exhalation due to shortness of breath.  3: The next ratio is 1:2:2:1. Begin with the count of 5:10:10:5. Do not increase the count for inhalation until the relative counts for exhalation and breath retentions are comfortable.  Stage  4: The next ratio, 1:3:2, is intermediary. First reduce the count, inhale for a count of 5, do internal kumbhaka for a count of 15 and exhale for a count of 10.  . Practise until the ratio is comfortable and there is no tendency to speed up the count during retention or exhala- tion due to shortness of breath.  4: Antar and Bahir Kumbhaka (internal and external retention)  In this technique bahir kumbhaka or outer breath retention is introduced. Do not try to hold the breath outside for long at first, even though it may seem easy.  Stage 4: The next ratio is 1:2:2:2. Begin with the count of 5:10:10:10. Build up the count gradually without strain.  Stage  5: The final ratio is 1:4:2. Begin with 5:20:10. Once the ratio has been established, the count can gradually increase.   practice: (addition of bandhas) Before applying the bandhas in this practice, they should be perfected as individual practices. For details of these practices refer to the section Bandha. When adding bandhas, reduce the ratio and count so that it is effortless. Extend the count gradually as previously instructed. Jalandhara practice: (addition of bandhas)  When technique 4 has been mastered, it may be practised in conjunction with jalandhara, moola and uddiyana bandhas.  First practise jalandhara bandha with internal breath retention only. When this has been perfected, combine jalandhara bandha with external breath retention also. When this has been mastered, combine jalandhara and moola bandha with internal and external retention. When this hasbeen perfected, maha bandhacan be added during external retention. At the end of the exhalation, practise jalandhara, moola and uddiyana bandhas. Main- tain the bandhas throughout the external retention. Release jalandhara, moola and uddiyana, in this order, at the end of external retention.  Finally, when this has been perfected, maha bandha can be added during both internal and external retention. Adjust the ratio of the breath to suit individual capacity.  393 practice: (addition of bandhas)  Once jalandhara bandha is perfected, it may also be combined with this practice during internal retention.  bandha: First practise jalandhara bandha with internal breath retention. Inhale through the left nostril, hold thebreath and practise jalandhara bandha with internal retention. Release jalandhara and exhale through the right nostril. Inhale through the right nostril. Practise jalandhara bandha with internal retention. Release jalandhara and exhale through the left nostril. This is one round, practise 5 rounds.  bandhas: Reduce the count and com- bine jalandhara bandha with moola bandha. Inhale through the left nostril. Close both nostrils and hold the breath inside. Practise jalandhara bandha and then moola bandha. After the required count of retention, release moolabandha and then jalandhara. Exhale through the right nostril. Inhale through the right nostril and hold the breath inside. Practise jalandhara bandha and moola bandha. Release mool bandha and then jalandhara. Exhale through the left nostril. This is one round. Practise 5 rounds.  Precaution: Do not practise pranayama with bandhas without the guidance of a competent teacher or guru.  391 Precaution: Do not practise in a polluted atmosphere or during cold weather. The nose heats up and cleans the inhaled air before it enters the delicate lungs. However, breathing through the mouth bypasses this air-conditioning and the induction of cold or dirty air directly into the  lungs may cause harm. Practise inner retention for a short time only as prolonged kumbhaka has a heating effect.   S$: The next ratio is 1:3:2:2. Begin with the count of 5:15:10:10. Each time the ratio is changed, use the same care to start with a low count, which is allowed to build up gradually without strain.  Stage  6: The final ratio is 1:4:2:2. Begin with the count of 5:20:10:10.  Advanced  Precautions: Under no circumstance should the breath be forced. Never breathe through the mouth. Proceed care- fully and only under the guidance of a competent teacher. At the slightest sign of discomfort, reduce the duration of inhalation/exhalation/retention and, if necessary, discon- tinue the practice. Nadi shodhana should never be rushed or forced.   Sequence: If one of the nostrils is blocked, perform jala neti  or breath balancing exercises before commencing. Nadi shodhana should be practised after shatkarma and asanas, and before other pranayamas. The best time to practise is around sunrise; however, it may be performed at any time during the day, except after meals.  Sequence: Practise after asanas and other yogic practices which heat the body in order to restore temperature balance.  396 Technique  Duration: 5 to 10 rounds or 10 to 15 minutes daily.  Duration: With practice, the duration of the inhalation should gradually become longer to increase the cooling effect. Gradually increase the number of rounds from 9 to 15. For general purposes 15 rounds is sufficient; however, up to 60 rounds may be performed in very hot weather.   Note: The word nadi means ‘channel’ or ‘flow’ of energy and  shodhana means ‘purification’. Nadi shodhana, therefore, means that practice which purifies the nadis. The number 24, used for timing the breath, derives from classical texts, which use the Gayatri mantra as a metre to measure the length of pranayamas. The Gayatri mantra is made up of 24 individual matras or sound syllables.  395 SHEETAL] PRANAYAMA     Sheetali Pranayama (cooling breath)  Technique | Sit in any comfortable meditation posture.  Close the eyes and relax the whole body.  Extend the tongue outside the mouth as far as possible without strain.Roll the sides of the tongue up so that it forms a tube. Practise a long, smooth and controlled inhalation through the rolled tongue.  At the end of inhalation, draw the tongue in, close the mouth and exhale through the nose.  Practise yogic breathing throughout.  The breath should produce a sucking sound.  A feeling of icy coldness will be experienced on the tongue and the roof of the mouth. This is one round.  Note: Sheetali is derived from the root sheet, which means ‘cold’. Sheetal means ‘that which is calm, passionless and soothing’.  397                                                                                                       ","Awareness: Physical — on the breath and the counting. Mental - it is easy for the mind to wander during nadi shodhana. Simply be aware of this wandering tendency of the mind while continuing the practice and the count. This will automatically encourage the awareness to return to the practice.  Spiritual — on ajna chakra.  Awareness: On the tongue, the sound and the cooling sensa- tion of the inhaled breath.  ","Breathing: Breathing should be silent in all techniques of  nadi shodhana, ensuring that it is not forced or restricted in any way. As the ratio and duration increases, the breath becomes very light and subtle. Increased ratios and breath duration should not be attained at the expense of relaxation, rhythm and awareness. The flow of breath must be smooth, with no jerks, throughout the practice.  ","Benefits: Technique 1 increases awareness of and sensitivity to the breath in the nostrils. Minor blockages are removed and the flow of breath in both nostrils becomes more balanced. Breathing through the left nostril tends to activate the right brain hemisphere; breathing through the right nostril activates the left hemisphere. The long,  386 slow, balanced breathing of stage 2 has profound effects, calming and balancing the energies.  Practice Benefits: Technique 2 gives more pronounced balancing of the breath and the brain hemispheres. It has calming effects and relieves anxiety, improves concentration and stimulates ajna chakra.  The ratio 1:1 in stage 1 establishes a calming rhythm for the brain and heart, assisting people with cardiovascular and nervous disorders specifically, and stress-related condi- tions generally.  As the count is extended, the breath slows down. The respiration becomes more efficient because the air flow is smoother and less turbulent. This ratio helps people with respiratory problems such as asthma, emphysema and bronchitis.  The ratio 1:2 in stage 2 gives profound relaxation. The heartbeat and pulse rate slow, and blood pressure drops, but the extension of count should be built up slowly.  388 Technique Benefits: The inner retention of breath, which characterizes technique 3, activates various brain centres and harmonizes the pranas. The benefits increase with the progression of  390 the ratios. The ratio 1:4:2 is most widely recommended in the yogic texts. It gives profound psychological and pranic effects and is used as a preparation for kundalini awakening. Advanced Benefits: The ratio 1:4:2 with bandhas purifies and balances the pranic forces.  Technique Benefits: Nadi shodhana ensures that the whole body is nourished by an extra supply of oxygen. Carbon dioxide is efficiently expelled and the blood is purified of toxins. The brain centres are stimulated to work nearer to their optimum capacity. It also induces tranquillity, clarity of thought and concentration, and is recommended for those engaged in mental work. It increases vitality and lowers levels of stress and anxiety by harmonizing the pranas. It clears pranic blockages and balances idaand pingala nadis,  394 causing sushumna nadi to flow, which leads to deep states of meditation and spiritual awakening.  Practice Benefits: This practice cools the body and affects important brain centres associated with biological drives and tem- perature regulation. It cools and reduces mental and emotional excitation, and encourages the free flowof prana throughout the body. It induces muscular relaxation, mental tranquillity and may be used as a tranquillizer before sleep. It gives control over hunger and thirst, and generates a feeling of satisfaction.  Practice ","Contra-indications: Nadi shodhana is not to be practised while suffering from colds, flu or fever.  Contra-indications: Stage 2 of technique 2 begins the process ofintroversion, which is not recommended fora depressed or withdrawn person. The extension of stage 2, involving longer counts, is not recommended for people with heart problems.  Contra-indications: Technique 3 is not suitable for women in the later half of pregnancy. It is not recommended for persons with heart problems, high blood pressure, emphy- sema or any major disorders.  Stage 2 is not recommended for asthmatics.  Contra-indications: People suffering from low blood pressure  or respiratory disorders such as asthma, bronchitis and excessive mucous, should not practise this pranayama. Those with heart disease should practise without breath retention. This practice cools down the activity of the lower energy centres and therefore those suffering from chronic con- stipation should avoid it. Generally, this pranayama should not be practised in winter or in cool climates.  ",,,,,,
1,ADVASANA," note: Mantra may also be synchronized with the breath as in shavasana.  88                    Duration: For relaxation in the treatment of ailments, it should be performed for as long as is comfortable. Before or during an asana session, a few minutes is sufficient.                                                                                                     ","Awareness: Physical —on relaxing the whole body, and on the breath.  Spiritual — on ajna or manipura chakra.  ",Breathing: Natural and rhythmic. The number of breaths may be counted as in shavasana while gently pushing the abdomen against the floor.  ,"Benefits: Recommended for those with slipped disc, stiff neck and stooping figure.  Practice ",,,,,,,
2,AGNISARA KRIYA," note: This kriya is an excellent practice to strengthen and develop control over the abdominal muscles and the diaphragm. It is also used as a preparatory practice for uddiyana bandha and nauli.  Note. The words agni and vahni both mean fire’; sara means ‘essence’, and kriya means ‘action’ The essence or nature of fire is attributed to the digestive process. If the abdominal organs are not working properly, the digestive fire smoulders and needs to be stoked or fanned to increase its power. Agnisara kriya does just that, as well as purifying the digestive system and its associated organs, and allowing the optimum assimilation of nutrients from food ingested.  507            practice: Swana Pranayama (panting breath) Sit in bhadrasana, keeping the big toes in contact with each other. Place the hands on the knees and close the eyes.  Relax the whole body for a few minutes, especially the abdomen.  Straighten the arms and lean forward slightly.  Keep the head erect.  Open the mouth wide and extend the tongue outside. Breathe in a panting manner through the mouth, with the tongue extended.  506       Contract and expand the abdomen rapidly.  While contracting the abdomen, breathe out and while expanding the abdomen, breathe in.  The breathing should be passive, only occurring because the movement of the abdomen is being accentuated. It should resemble the panting of a dog.  Keep the chest as still as possible. Do not strain.  Breathe in and out 10 to 20 times.  This is one round. Practise 3 rounds.  Relax and breathe normally between rounds.        Precautions: During summer months, this practice should be performed with care as it may raise the body heat and blood pressure excessively. During this period, it should always be followed bya cooling pranayama such as sheetkari or sheetali.   Sequence: Practise after asanas. Agnisara kriya should be practised on an empty stomach, preferably in the early morning before breakfast, and ideally after the bowels have been emptied.   Duration: Beginners may find this practice difficult and quickly become tired due to lack of voluntary control over the abdominal muscles. The muscles must be slowly and gradually developed over a period of time.  Three rounds of 10 abdominal contractions and expan- sions is sufficient at first. With regular practice, up to 50  505 abdominal movements may be performed with each round. The time of breath retention should be gradually increased over a period of time.                                                                                                     ",Awareness: Physical — on the abdominal movement. Spiritual —- on manipura chakra.  Awareness: Physical —on synchronizing the breath rhyth- mically with the abdominal movement.  Spiritual — on manipura chakra.  Practice ,,"Benefits: Agnisara kriya stimulates the appetite and improves the digestion. It massages the abdomen, strengthens the abdominal muscles and encourages optimum health of the abdominal organs. Agnisara kriya stimulates the five pranas, especially samana, and raises the energy levels markedly. It alleviates depression, dullness and lethargy.  Preparatory ","Contra-indications: People suffering from high blood pres- sure, heart disease, acute duodenal or peptic ulcers, overactive thyroid gland or chronic diarrhoea should not perform this kriya.  Women who are pregnant should refrain from this practice.  ",,,,,,
3,AKARNA DHANURASANA,                                                                                                                      ,"Awareness: On the tensing of the arms, the imaginary target, and on the breath synchronized with the movement. ",Breathing: Inhale while pulling back the bowstring. Exhale while releasing the bowstring and bringing the hand forward.  ,"Benefits: This asana exercises the shoulders and also uses the short and deep muscles of the neck and shoulder blades. These muscles are not often exercised and can hold a significant amount of postural and subconscious tension which is responsible for stiffness and pain. The alternate tensing and relaxing smoothes out the energy flow and relaxes the muscles. This asana is helpful for people with bad posture, cervical spondylitis, writer’s cramp and shoul-  der or arm stiffness.  141  ",,,,,,,
4,AKASHI MUDRA," note: It is recommended that the practitioner be completely familiar with the practices of ujjayi, khechari and shambhavi before commencing akashi mudra. At first ujjayl pranayama may irritate the throat when performed with the head back. However, with practice, it will become more comfortable.  Note-Akashi mudra belongs to the group of techniques featuring gazing at an external focal point as a means to achieving dharana or the meditative state of relaxed concentration.  448               Precaution: As soon as faintness is felt, stop the practice. This technique must be practised slowly under the guidance of a competent teacher.  442      Duration: Begin with one round and gradually increase to 5.

As the body is steadied, the mind becomes calm and gives a firm foundation for concentration.

They increase the ability to sit in padmasana for extended periods of time as required for advanced meditation practices, but should only be practised by people who can already sit in padmasanawithout the slightest difficulty or strain.  Those who suffer from sciatica or weak or injured knees should not perform these asanas until flexibility of the knees has been developed through practice of the pre-meditation asanas. Padmasana is not advisable during pregnancy as the circulation in the legs is reduced. The contra-indications given for individual asanas should also be closely observed.  In all the asanas discussed in this chapter, either the left or the right leg may be placed uppermost. It is a matter of per- sonal preference and depends on whichever is more comfortable.

14,ASHWINI MUDRA,"   |: Rapid contraction Sit in any comfortable meditation asana. Close the eyes and relax the whole body. Become aware of the natural breathing process. Take the awareness to the anus. Rapidly contract the anal sphincter muscles for a few seconds without straining, then relax them. Confine the action to the anal area. Contraction and relaxation should be performed 10 to 20 times, smoothly and rhythmically. Gradually make the contractions more rapid.  Technique   2: Contraction with antar kumbhaka Sit in any comfortable meditation asana. Close the eyes and relax the whole body. Inhale slowly and deeply while simultaneously contracting the anal sphincter muscles. Practise antar kumbhaka (internal breath retention) while holding the contraction of the anal sphincter muscles as tightly as possible without strain. Exhale while releasing the contraction of the anus. Perform 5 to 10 rounds.          bandhas: jalandhara, moola, uddiyana and maha. The last of these is a combination of the first three. These three bandhas act directly on the three granthis or psychic knots. Moola bandha is associated with brahma granthi, uddiyana bandha with vishnu granthi and jalandhara bandha with rudra granthi. The granthis prevent the free flow of prana along  47) sushumna nadi and thus impede the awakening of the chakras and the rising of kundalini.  Brahma granthi is the first knot and it is associated with mooladhara and swadhisthana chakras. It is linked with the survival instinct, the urge to procreate and with deep, instinctive knowledge, awareness and desire. When brahma granthi is transcended, the kundalini or primal energy is able to rise beyond mooladhara and swadhisthana without being pulled back down by the attractions and instinctual patterns of the personality.  The second knot is vishnu granthi, associated with manipura and anahata chakras. These two chakras deal with the sustenance of the physical, emotional and mental aspects of human existence. Manipura sustains pranamaya kosha, the energy body, governing the digestion and metabolism of food. Anahata sustains manomaya kosha, the mental body, and they both affect annamaya kosha, the physical body. Once vishnu granthi is transcended, one is no longer bound by physical, mental and emotional attachments. Relationships and energy become more universal, rather than being limited by personal preferences or aversions.  The final knot is rudra granthi, which is associated with vishuddhi and ajna chakras. Vishuddhi and ajna sustain uynanamaya kosha, the intuitive or higher mental body, and represent the transformation of an existing form, idea or conceptinto its universal aspect. Whenrudra granthiis pierced, individuality is dropped. The old egoidentification is left behind and the experience of unmanifest consciousness, beyond the phenomenal universe, emerges at ajna and sahasrara chakras.  472        Duration: Begin with 3 contractions, Slowly increase to 10.  Note: Ashwini means ‘horse’. The practice resembles the movement a horse makes with its sphincter immediately after evacuation of the bowels.  466    VAJROLI/SAHAJOLI MUDRA  Vajroli Mudra (for men)/Sahajoli Mudra (for women) (thunderbolt/spontaneous psychic attitude)  Sit in siddha/siddha yoni asana, or any comfortable meditation posture with the head and spine straight. Place the hands on the knees in chin or jnana mudra. Close the eyes and relax the whole body.  Take the awareness to the urethra.  Inhale, hold the breath inside and draw the urethra upward. This action is similar to holding back an intense urge to urinate. The testes in men and the labia in women should move slightly upward during this contraction.  Confine the contraction to the urethra.  Hold the contraction for as long as comfortable, starting with a few seconds, and gradually increasing.  Exhale, releasing the contraction, and relax.                 BI: Hey STHUTRTCTTTT, te  Jaalandharodd yaananamoolabandhaa njalpanti kanthodarapaayumoolaan.

If their duration can be increased, then where is the fear of death?  Yogataravali (Sutra 5; Sri Adi Shankaracharya)       Introduction to Bandha  ""[aditionally, bandhas were classified as part of mudras, and were handed down by word of mouth from guru to disciple. The Hatha Yoga Pradipika deals with bandhas and mudras together and the ancient tantric texts also make no distinction between the two. Bandhas are extensively incor- porated in mudra as well as pranayama techniques. Their locking action, however, reveals them as a fundamentally important group of practices in their own right.  The Sanskrit word bandha means to ‘hold’, ‘tighten’ or ‘lock’. These definitions precisely describe the physical action involved in the bandha practices and their effect on the pranic body. The bandhas aim to lock the pranas in particular areas and redirect their flow into sushumna nadi for the purpose of spiritual awakening.  Bandhasshouldfirst be practised and mastered individually. Only then can they be beneficially incorporated with mudra and pranayama practices. When combined in this way, they awaken the psychic faculties and form an adjunct to higher yogic practices. However, it is important to observe the contra- indications.  Bandhas and the granthis  There are four                                                                                    ","Awareness: Physical — on anal contraction and relaxation. Spiritual - on mooladhara chakra.  Awareness: Physical - on isolating the point of contraction, avoiding generalized contraction of the pelvic floor.  Spiritual — on swadhisthana chakra.  ",,"Benefits: This practice strengthens the anal muscles. It pre- vents the escape of pranic energy and redirects it upward for spiritual purposes.  Benefits: Vajroli/sahajoli mudra regulates and tones the entire uro-genital system. It helps overcome psycho-sexual con- flicts and unwanted sexual thoughts. It conserves and redirects energy, enhancing meditative states.  Note. The word vajroli is derived from the Sanskrit root vajra, which means ‘thunderbolt’, ‘lightning’ or ‘mighty one’. Vajra is also the name of the nadi which conducts sexual energy. Sahajoli is from the root sahaj, meaning ‘spontaneous’. Vajroli is therefore the force which moves upward with the power of lightning, and sahajoli is the psychic attitude of spontaneous arousing.  467       ITNT S ATOM  Beat Bvsreraryaery araasfaratteitaart  ",Contra-indications: People with high blood pressure or heart disease should not practise with antar kumbhaka.

It reverses the flow of apana, directing the energy towards manipura chakra, helping to maintain brahmacharya, ‘celibacy’. It strengthens the wrists, the arm and leg muscles, and the muscles of the abdomen.  Note. Astavakrasana is dedicated to Sage Astavakra, the spiritual preceptor of King Janaka of Mithila. When the sage was in his mother’s womb, his father Kagola made several mistakes while reciting the Vedas. Hearing these, the unborn sage laughed. His father became enraged and cursed his son to be born crooked. So it came to pass that he was born twisted in eight places, and was thus named Astavakra.  354  ","Contra-indications: This pose should not be attempted until the arms and shoulders have become very strong.

21,BHAIRAVA MUDRA,"                     Variation: When the left hand is placed on top of the right, the practice is called Bhairavi mudra. Bhairavi is the female counterpart of Bhairava.  Note. The two hands represent ida and pingala nadis, and the union of the individual with the supreme consciousness. Bhairava mudra is used in prana mudra. It may also be used during pranayama and meditation practice.  429                                                                                                   ",,,,,,,,,,
22,BHASTRIKA PRANAYAMA," note: When accustomed to this style of breathing, gradually increase the speed, always keeping the breath rhythmical. The force of inhalation and exhalation must be equal.  Technique note: If the exhalation seems locked after retention, a slight inhalation before exhalation releases the locked condition of the glottis and brings the respiratory muscles back into action.  Advanced practice (addition of bandhas) Jalandhara and moola bandhas should be perfected as individual practices betore being applied in this practice. After antar kumbhaka has been mastered, jalandhara and moola bandha may be practised during internal breath retention. At the end of each round, inhale deeply and hold the breath inside. Practise jalandhara bandha and then moola bandha. After the required count of retention, release moola bandha, jalandhara bandha, and then exhale.    |: Preparatory practice Sit in a comfortable meditation posture with the hands resting on the knees in either chin or jnana mudra. Keep the head and spine straight, close the eyes and relax the whole body.  Take a deep breath in and breathe out forcefully through the nose. Immediately afterwards breathe in with the same force. Forceful inhalation results from fully expanding the abdominal muscles and forceful exhalation from firm contraction of the abdominal muscles. Do not strain. . During inhalation, the diaphragm descends and the abdomen moves outward. During exhalation, the dia- phragm moves upward and the abdomen moves inward. The movements should be slightly exaggerated. Continue in this manner, counting 10 breaths.  Take a deep breath in and breathe out slowly.  This is one round. Practise up to 5 rounds.  Practice   2: Alternate nostrils Sit in a comfortable meditation asana, preferably pad- masana or siddha/siddha yoni asana. Keep the head and spine straight. Close the eyes and relax the whole body. Raise the right hand and perform nasagra mudra.  Left    3: with Antar Kumbhaka (inner retention) Once technique 2 has been mastered.  Left  4: with Bahir Kumbhaka (external retention) After technique 3 has been mastered, external retention may be commenced.  After perfecting the practice with external retention, maha bandha may be applied. Maha bandha should first be perfected as an individual practice.  At the end of each round, inhale deeply through both nostrils and then exhale completely.  Hold the breath outside for a few seconds.  Practise maha bandha.  Release maha bandha and inhale.       Precaution: Before practising pranayama with bandhas seek the guidance of a competent teacher.     Precautions: Bhastrika is a dynamic practice requiring a large expenditure of physical energy. Beginners are advised to take a short rest after each round. Avoid violent respiration, facial contortions and excessive shaking of the body. A feeling of faintness, excessive perspiration or vomiting indicates that the practice is being performed incorrectly.  406 If any of these symptoms are experienced, the advice of a competent teacher should be sought.  This practice purifies the blood. However, if the stages are rushed, all the impurities will be ejected from the body in a rush, which may exacerbate conditions caused by detoxification. A slow, conscientious approach to this practice is therefore recommended.    Duration: Ten breaths through the left, the right and both nostrils, as above, forms one complete round.  Practise up to 5 rounds.  Duration: Up to 5 rounds. The duration of inner retention can gradually be increased up to 30 seconds.  Do not strain.  Duration: Up to 5 rounds.  The duration of external retention can be gradually increased up to 30 seconds. Do not strain.   Note: The Sanskrit word bhastrika means ‘bellows’. Thus, bhastrika pranayama is also known as the bellows breath, as air is drawn forcefully in and out of the lungs like the bellows of a village blacksmith. The bellows increases the flow of air into the fire, producing more heat. Similarly, bhastrika pranayama increases the flow of air into the body to produce inner heat at both the physical and subtle levels, stoking the inner fire of mind/body.  409                     nostril: Close the right nostril with the thumb. Breathe in and out forcefully, without straining, through the left nostril 10 times. There should be a snuffing sound in the nose, but no sound should come from the throat or chest.  405 The abdomen should expand and contract rhythmically with the breath. The pumping action should be performed by the abdomen alone; the chest, shoulders and face remain relaxed.  After 10 breaths, take a deep breath in and breathe out through the left nostril.  Right nostril: Close the left nostril and repeat the same process through the right nostril.  Both nostril: Close the right nostril with the thumb. Breathe in and out forcefully through the left nostril. The abdomen should expand and contract rhythmically with the breath.  407 After completing the forceful breaths, take a deep breath in, expanding both the abdomen and the chest, close both nostrils and retain the breath for a few seconds.  Exhale through the left nostril  Right nostril: Close the left nostril and repeat the same process through the right nostril.  Both  nostrils: Replace the raised hand on the knee.  Repeat the same process through both nostrils.  nostrils: After completing the forceful breaths through both nostrils, inhale slowly and deeply, close both nostrils and retain the breath for a few seconds.  Breathe out slowly through both nostrils. This is one round. Practise up to 5 rounds.  Practice  rates: slow, medium and fast, depending on individual capacity.  Slow bhastrika is approximately one breath every 2 seconds, with no undue force on inhalation or exhalation. It is like amplified normal breathing. It is especially useful for beginners, but may also be practised at all stages. Medium breathing increases the speed of respiration to approximately one breath every second.  Fast breathing means a speed of around 2 breaths per second. Both medium and fast breathing are suitable for intermediate and advanced practitioners.  As abdominal muscles become stronger with regular practice, the number of respirations may be increased by 5 per month until the count of 50 respirations is attained.   humours: kapha, phlegm; pitta, bile; and vata, wind. It is a useful practice for women during labour after a few months of proper preparation.  Because of the rapid exchange of air in the lungs, there is an increase in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide into and out of the bloodstream. This stimulates the metabolic rate, producing heat and flushing out wastes and toxins. The rapid and rhythmic movement of the diaphragm also massages and stimulates the visceral organs, toning the digestive system.  Bhastrika reduces the level of carbon dioxide in the blood. It helps to alleviate inflammation in the throat and any accumulation of phlegm. It balances and strengthens the nervous system, inducing peace, tranquillity and one- pointedness of mind in preparation for meditation.  Technique                                                                                ",Awareness: Physical — on the breathing process and the physi- cal movement of the abdomen.

23,BHOOCHARI MUDRA," note: Bhoochari mudra should be practised in a meditative asana. It is best performed facing a blank wall or an open space, such as the sky or a body of still water. This ensures that there are no visual obstructions to distract the attention.                     Note: Bhoochari mudra may be performed as a preparation for meditation and as a meditation technique in its own right. It belongs to a group of techniques featuring gazing at an external focal point as a means to achieve dharana or the meditative state of relaxed concentration. It is allied to nasikagra drishti and shambhavi mudras, all three being forms of trataka.  44]                                                                                                    ",Awareness: Physical — on the sensation of complete relaxation and stillness.

24,BHRAMARI PRANAYAMA," note: Inner retention should be gradually increased as it helps in increasing introversion and concentration. Do not strain when performing kumbhaka; one or two seconds is sufficient at first. The duration may be increased gradually as the technique is mastered.  Advanced     2: with Antar Kumbhaka (inner retention) Inhale slowly and deeply through the nose. Retain the breath inside with awareness at ajna or bindu. The exhalation should be as long as is comfortable to enhace the mind’s absorption in the humming sound.        practice: The best time to practise is late at night or in the early morning as there are fewer external noises to interfere with internal perception. Practising at this time  400 awakens psychic sensitivity. However, bhramari may be practised at any time to relieve mental tension.  practice: (addition of bandhas) Before applying the bandhas in this practice, they should be perfected as individual practices. Once antar kumbhaka has been mastered, jalandhara and moola bandhas may be incorporated. For details of these practices refer to the section on Bandha. The full form of jalandhara can be practised if the hands are returned to the knees between rounds. If the hands remain raised, plugging the ears, then practise the simple variation of jalandhara. Inhale for a long smooth breath. Practise jalandhara and then moola bandha during internal retention for a comfortable duration.  401 Release moola bandha and then jalandhara bandha, and exhale through the nose. This is one round. Once the bandha can be held without strain, gradually build up the number of rounds.     Precaution: Do not practise pranayama with bandhas without the guidance of a competent teacher or guru.       Duration: 5 to 10 rounds is sufficient in the beginning, then slowly increase to 10 to 15 minutes. In cases of extreme mental tension or anxiety, or when used to assist the healing process, practise for up to 30 minutes.

25,BHU NAMANASANA,                  Sequence: This asana should be practised after completing a series of forward and backward bending asanas. It also stretches the legs and spine when performed after long periods of time sitting in a meditation posture. It is a preparatory practice for more advanced twisting asanas such as ardha matsyendrasana.                                                                                                      ,Awareness: Physical - on relaxation of the back and on the breath.

Bring the forehead as close to the kneesas possible without straining.            Sequence: This asana gives maximum benefits if preceded or followed by a forward bending asana. It may also be performed in conjunction with shalabhasana and dhanur- asana for effective general health of the back and spine.   Duration: For spiritual benefits, practise 3 to 12 rounds slowly. For physical benefits, practise 3 to 12 rounds more quickly. Beginners should start with 2 or 3 rounds and add one more round every few weeks to avoid fatigue. Advanced students may practise a larger number of rounds; however, strain should be avoided at all times. In special cases, a daily practice of 108 rounds may be undertaken for purification, but only under the guidance of a competent teacher.  Beeja Duration: Practise up to 5 rounds, gradually increasing the length of time in the final position.     Mantra: Om Hiranya Garbhaya Namaha, salutations to the golden, cosmic self.  171 Position Mantra: Om Manchaye Namaha, salutations to the Lord of the Dawn.  Position Mantra: Om Adityaya Namaha, salutations to the son of Aditi, the cosmic Mother.  Position Mantra: Om Savitre Namaha, salutations to the Lord ofCreation.  Position | Mantra: Om Arkaya Namaha, salutations to he who is fit to be praised.  Position Mantra: Om Bhaskaraya Namaha, salutations to he who leads to enlightenment.  Positions  7: Bhujangasana (cobra pose) Keep the hands and feet in place. Slide the chest forward and raise first the head, the shoul- ders, then, straightening the elbows, arch the back into the cobra pose. This will lower the buttocks and hips to the floor. Bend the head back and direct the gaze upward to the eyebrow centre. The thighs and hips remain on the floor and the arms support the trunk. Unlessthespine is very flexible the arms will remain slightly bent.   8: Parvatasana (mountain pose) The hands and feet do not move from position 7. From bhujangasana assume parvatasana. Keep the arms and legs straight, grip the floor with the toes and use the strength of the arms to raise the buttocks and lower the heels to the floor.   9: Ashwa Sanchalanasana (equestrian pose) Keep the palms flat on the floor and the right foot in place. Bend the left leg and bring the left foot forward between the hands. Simultaneously, lower the right knee so that it touches the floor and push the pelvis forward. Tilt the head backward, arch the back and gaze at the eyebrow centre.   1: Hasta Utthanasana (raised arms pose) Keep the arms and spine in a straight line. Raise the torso and stretch the arms above the head. Keep the arms separated, shoulder width apart. Bend the head, arms and upper trunk backward slightly.        Conclusion: On the completion of each half round, lower the arms to the side, relax the body and concentrate on the breath until it returns to normal. After completing surya namaskara, practise shavasana for a few minutes. This will allow the heartbeat and respiration to return to normal and all the muscles to relax.         |2: Pranamasana (prayer pose)  Bring the palms together in front of the chest.  13-24: The twelve positions of surya namaskara are practised twice to complete one round. Positions 1 to 12 constitute half a round. In the second half, the positions are repeated with two small changes related to ashwa  sanchalanasana:  a) In position 16, instead of stretching the right foot backward, stretch the left foot back.  b) In position 21, bend the right leg and bring the right foot between the hands.   mantras: As an alternative to the twelve names of the sun, there is a series of bija mantras or seed syllables. Bija mantras do not have any literal meaning, but set up powerful vibrations of energy within the mind and body.  173 The six bija mantras are repeated consecutively in the following order, four times during a complete round of surya  namaskara:  1. Om Hraam 4. Om Hraim 2. Om Hreem 5. Om Hraum 3. Om Hroom 6. Om Hrah  Bija mantras are used when surya namaskara is practised too fast to repeat the sun mantras, or in order to deepen the practice.  174 Chandra Namaskara  SALUTATIONS TO THE MOON  Theword chandra means ‘moon’. Just as the moon, having no light of its own, reflects the light of the sun, so the practice of chandra namaskara reflects that of surya namaskara. The se- quence of asanas is the same as surya namaskara except that ardha chandrasana, the half moon pose, is performed after ashwa sanchalanasana. This is a significant change. The pos- ture develops balance and concentration, which adds another dimension to the practice. It also makes the breathing pattern more demanding, prolonging inhalation and exhalation/ retention.  Whereas the twelve positions of surya namaskara relate to the twelve zodiac or solar phases of the year, the fourteen positions of chandra namaskara relate to the fourteen lunar phases. In the lunar calander the fourteen days before the full moon are known as shukla paksha, the bright fortnight, and the fourteen days after the full moon are known as krishna paksha, the dark fortnight.  The lunar energy flows within ida nadi. It has cool, relaxing and creative qualities. Ida is the introverted, feminine or mental force which is responsible for consciousness.  Preparation  It is advisable to learn surya namaskara before attempting chandra namaskara as the postures are the same for both, except for one extra pose. In chandra namaskara the added pose, ardha chandrasana, is inserted in the sequence at positions 5 and 11, in the first half of the round, and positions 19 and 25 in the second. Ardha chandrasana is described as an  175 independent practice in the backward bending section. Its insertion as position 5 prolongs the inhalation begun in ashwa sanchalanasana, then prolongs the exhalation and external retention through postions 6 and 7 (parvatasana and ashtanga namaskara). Its insertion as position 11 similarly lengthens inhalation and then exhalation into padahastasana.  Time of practice  Chandra namaskara is best practised in the evening or at night, especially when the moon is visible, or at dawn at the time of the full moon. When practising at night, ensure that the stomach is empty.  Awareness  Before beginning chandra namaskara, a few moments should be given to prepare the body and mind.  -Stand in the upright position with the feet together, the eyes closed and the arms at the sides. The weight of the body should be evenly distributed on both feet. Observe any sponta- neous movement of the body as it relaxes.  Gradually become more aware of the natural flow of the breath with each inhalation and exhalation. Then include awareness of the movement in the body with the rhythm of the breath. Retain this awareness for a few moments.  Slowly withdraw the awareness from the breath and become aware of bhrumadhya, the space between the eyebrows. Within this space, visualize the full moon in a clear night sky, shining brightly upon the waves of the ocean. The full reflection of the moon penetrates the deep waters and the cool shade of moonlight catches the tops of the waves as they dance.

This affects the pelvic structure and stretches the outer rather than the inner muscles of the thigh. This position also massages and tones the pelvic and reproductive organs.  105 Vajrasana Group of Asanas  The vajra or thunderbolt is said to be the weapon of Indra, king of the devas or gods, just as the mind is the king of all the senses. Vajrasana is highly thought of as a meditation posture in many cultures throughout the world. Vajra is also the major nadi directly connected with the genito-urinary system, which regulates the sexual energy in the body. Control of vajra nadi leads to sublimation and control ofsexualenergy. The vajrasana series is therefore very beneficial for the reproductive as well as digestive organs and is also reasonably easy to perform.  Right-handed people will generally find that these asanas are easily learned with the right side leading. They should then be performed with the left side leading to counter bal- ance the effects of habitual behaviour patterns.  ",,,,,,,

Surya namaskara has been handed down from the enlightened sages of the vedic age. The sun symbol- izes spiritual consciousness and in ancient times was worshipped on a daily basis. In yoga the sun is represented by pingala or surya nadi, the pranic channel which carries the vital, life- giving force.  This dynamic group of asanas is not a traditional part of hatha yoga practices as it was added to the original asana group at a later time. However, it is an effective way of loosen- ing up, stretching, massaging and toning all the joints, muscles and internal organs of the body. Its versatility and application make it one of the most useful methods of inducing a healthy, vigorous and active life, while at the same time preparing for spiritual awakening and the resulting expansion of awareness.  Surya namaskara is a complete sadhana, spiritual practice, in itself for it includes asana, pranayama, mantra and meditation techniques. It is an excellent group of asanas with which to start morning practice. Surya namaskara has a direct vitalizing effect on the solar energy of the body which flows through pingala nadi. Regular practice of surya namaskara regulates pingala nadi, whether it is underactive or overactive. Regulation of pingala nadi leads to a balanced energy system at both mental and physical levels.  Surya namaskara generates prana, the subtle energy which activates the psychic body. Its performance, in a steady, rhythmic sequence, reflects the rhythms of the universe; the twenty-four hours of the day, the twelve zodiac phases of the year and the biorhythms of the body. The application of this form and rhythm  162 to the body/mind complex generates the transforming force which produces a fuller and more dynamic life.  Preparation  Before practising surya namaskara, carefully observe the contra-indications for the seven component postures and en- sure that they can be performed comfortably. Positions 2 and 3 arecombined in the forward bending section as padahastasana variation. Positions 4 and 7 (ashwa sanchalanasana and bhujangasana) are described independently in the vajrasana and backward bending sections. Positions 8 to 12 repeat the first five postures in reverse order.  General contra-indications  The practice of surya namaskara should be immediately dis- continued ifa fever, acute inflammation, boils or rashes occur due to excess toxins in the body. When the toxins have been eliminated, the practice may be resumed.  Surya namaskara includes semi-inverted postures, so the cau- tions for inverted postures apply. It should not be practised by people suffering from high blood pressure, coronary artery dis- eases, or by those who have had a stroke, as it may overstimulate or damage a weak heart or blood vessel system. It should also be avoided in cases of hemia or intestinal tuberculosis.  People with back conditions should consult a medical ex- pert before commencing this practice. Conditions such as slipped disc and sciatica will be better managed through an alternative asana program.  During the onset of menstruation, this practice should be avoided. If there are no adverse effects, the practice may be resumed towards the end of the period. During pregnancy, it may be practised with care until the beginning of the twelfth week. Following childbirth, it may be commenced approximately forty days after delivery for re-toning the uterine muscles.  General benefits  The practice of surya namaskara as a whole gives a great number of benefits. It strengthens the back and helps balance  163 the metabolism. It stimulates and balances all the systems of the body, including the reproductive, circulatory, respiratory and digestive systems. Its influence on the endocrine glands helps to balance the transition period between childhood and adolescence in growing children.  Synchronizing the breath with the physical movements of surya namaskara ensures that the practitioner, at least for a few minutes daily, breathes as deeply and rhythmically as pos- sible, increasing mental clarity by bringing fresh, oxygenated blood to the brain.  Time of practice  The ideal time to practise surya namaskara is at sunrise, the most peaceful time of day, or sunset. Whenever possible, prac- tise in the open air, facing the rising sun. Surya namaskara, however, may be practised at any time provided the stomach is empty.  Awareness  Before commencing the practice, stand with the feet together or slightly apart, and the arms hanging loosely by the sides of the body. Close the eyes gently and become aware of the whole physical body as one homogeneous unit. Minimize swaying movements and balance the body weight equally on both feet.  Take the awareness to the soles of the feet in contact with the floor. Feel that the whole body is being pulled downwards by gravity and that any tensions are being pulled down through the body and into the ground. At the same time, experience the vital force surging up from the earth and flooding the whole being.  Bring the awareness inside the body and mentally begin to relax it. Starting from the top of the head, take the awareness systematically through all the parts, releasing any tension. Intensify, once more, the awareness of the whole physical body and feel in harmony with it.  Finally, take the awareness to the heart or eyebrow centre and visualize a brilliant, red rising sun infusing the whole body and mind with its vitalizing and healing rays.  164  ","Contra-indications: Not to be performed by people suffering from vertigo, high blood pressure, sciatica or hiatus hernia. Cautions for inverted postures apply.  ",,,,,,

It tones the adrenals and reproductive system.  242 Spinal Twisting Asanas  This is an important series of asanas for spinal health. Every asana program should include at least one practice from this group, preferably following the forward and backward bend- ing postures. The twist imposed on the spine and the whole trunk exercises the muscles, makes the spinal column more flexible and stimulates the spinal nerves. It also has a strong influence on the abdominal muscles, alternately stretching and compressing them as the body twists from one direction to the other. Beginners must be careful not to twist the trunk more than flexibility will allow. During pregnancy, meru wakrasana is the only asana recommended from this group. In general, also carefully observe the specific contra-indica- tions for each practice.  Most of the spinal twist asanas enhance the pranic flow in the samana region, around the navel. This nourishes organs such as the pancreas, kidneys, stomach, small intestines, liver and gall bladder, relieves associated disorders and rejuvenates the tissues generally. The samana region is also related to manipura chakra, a plexus of major nadis or pranic channels, supplying the whole body. Theseasanas therefore have a strong effect on total health and vitality.  On the emotional and psychic levels, controlled twisting and untwisting represents a means of managing the knots and prob- lems we encounter. These asanas give insight and inspire a systematic approach to untying the tangled knots of life.  Right-handed peoplewill find these asanasare easily learned with the right side leading. They should then be practised with the left side leading as a counterbalance.  243  ",Contra-indications: People with back complaints or a dis- placed coccyx should not practise this asana.  ,,,,,,

56,GOMUKHASANA,                                                                                                                      ,Awareness: Physical - on respiration. Spiritual — on ajna or anahata chakra.  ,Breathing: Normal in the final position.  218 ,"Benefits: Gomukhasana is an excellent asana for inducing relaxation. If practised for 10 minutes or more, it will alleviate tiredness, tension and anxiety. It relieves back- ache, sciatica, rheumatism and general stiffness in the shoulders and neck, and improves posture by increasing energy, awareness, and generally opening the chest area. It alleviates cramp in the legs and makes the leg muscles  supple.  219 Forward Bending Asanas  Generally speaking, forward bending is a passive process in which gravity is utilized to stretch the muscle groups being focused upon. While backward bends move the body away from the confines of gravity, forward bending asanas use gravity to help release tension and pain. It is a process of introversion, counteracting the extroversion and dynamic opening up of bending backwards. Forward bending, associated with chest compression and exhalation, induces relaxation.  Many people lead sedentary lifestyles with little or no exer- cise and, as a result, the body becomes stiff and unable to bend forward. City living encourages mental tension and physical rigidity, both of which are counteracted by forward bending asanas. At another level, forward bending is associated with bowing and humility. An inability to bend forward may indi- cate a stiff, proud or stubborn personality. Difficulty bending forward is also associated with fear. Human beings face for- ward to see the world, but some people live in constant fear of attack from behind and the backs of their bodies uncon- sciously freeze. Forward bending asanas release this rigidity.  Forward bending asanas loosen up the back, maintaining good health and increasing vitality. These practices move the spine into the position known as the primary curve, the shape it takes in the womb. During a forward bending asana each of the vertebra is separated, stimulating the nerves, improving circulation around the spine and nourishing the spinal cord. This has a positive impact on the organs of the body generally and on the brain specifically. This group of asanas is also very important for making the back muscles supple and strong,  220 compressing and massaging the abdominal organs, including the liver, kidneys, pancreas and intestines, and stretching the leg muscles and tendons.  Most forward bending asanas described in this book start by bending from the hips and not the waist. Bending from the hips gives greater flexibility of movement and creates a stronger pressure against the abdomen. Care must be taken not to force the back to bend further forward than present flexibility will allow; rather, the muscles should be relaxed, allowing gravity and exhalation to move the body. With regular practice, even the most rigid back will develop increased flexibility.  It is not advisable to practise all the forward bending asanas one after the other. Start with the preliminary practices and gradually build up to the more advanced ones as the back becomes more flexible. A balanced program of forward and then backward bending asanas should be carefully maintained. People with any kind of back condition and those suffering from backache should consult a doctor before practising these asanas. In general, also carefully observe the specific contra- indications for each practice.  Right-handed people will find these asanas are easily learned with the right side leading. They should then be practised with the left side leading as a counterbalance.  When practising forward bending asanas from a sitting position, particularly those in which the legs are separated, it is helpful to sit with the perineum on the floor, rather than sitting on the coccyx. The correct position is obtained by sit- ting with the legs slightly separated and placing the hands on the floor, on either side of the hips, with the fingertips point- ing forward. Then, using the arms and hands as supports, lift the buttocks slightly from the floor and, while lowering them, tilt the pelvis forward.  221  ",,,,,,,

The stretch of the muscles  4. Breathing  Periodic rest  Before starting the practice, the body and mind should be calm and relaxed. This is best achieved through the practice of shavasana. In addition, a short rest should be taken between asanas, lying in shavasana. One minute or thirty seconds should be sufficient, but a more reliable guide is to rest until the breathing returns to normal.  No strain  When starting this series, it is not advisable to attempt all the practices in one go, especially the ones which involve using both legs together. It is better to choose one practice at a time and incorporate that into the previous practices. The pawanmuktasana part 2 series requires a great deal of effort  45 and may put a strain on the lower back. Therefore, be aware of physical limitations and do not strain.  Contra-indications  These practices should not be performed by people suffering from high blood pressure, serious heart conditions, back con- ditions such as sciatica and slipped disc, or soon after abdominal surgery. If there is any doubt, please consult a competent therapist. In asanas where the feet are raised above the head, consult the cautions for inverted asanas as well as observing the contra-indications given for individual practices.  Starting position  All these asanas are performed by lying flat on the back with the legs together and straight. The arms should be by the sides, palms down, and the head, neck and spine in a straight line. Be sure to use a thin mat or a blanket, particularly with asanas such as supta pawanmuktasana and jhulana lurhakan- asana where the body is balanced on the spinal vertebrae.  Right-handed people will find these asanas are easily learned with the right side leading. They should then be practised with the left side leading to balance development of the limbs, nerves and behaviour patterns.  46                                                                         ","Awareness: On the stretching sensation of the muscles in the sides of the neck, and the breath.  42 aah,     asyo  Stage 3 Stage 4  Stage Awareness: On the movement and the breath.

71,JALA NETI," note: This step helps to drain trapped water from the sinus cavities.  3. Stand erect with the feet apart. Close the right nostril and exhale forcefully while bending forward rapidly from the waist. Inhale normally while returning to the upright position. Repeat 5 times.  Repeat with the right nostril open and then with both nostrils open. Do not blow the nose too hard as the remaining water may be pushed into the ears.  490 If necessary, perform shashankasana for several minutes to allow the drainage of any remaining water.  note: Jala neti may be practised either in a squatting position or standing. The latter is most suitable for doing neti overa sink while the former may be performed outside. After some practice, a full neti pot may be used for each nostril.     I: Washing the nostrils Fill the neti pot with the prepared salt water.  Stand squarely, with legs apart so that the body weight is evenly distributed between the feet. Lean forward and tilt the head to one side.  Breathe through the mouth.  Gently insert the nozzle into the uppermost nostril. There should be no force involved.  The nozzle should press firmly against the side of the  489 nostril so that no water leakage occurs. Tilt the neti pot in such a way that water runs into the nostril and not down the face. Keep the mouth open. Raising the elbow of the hand which holds the neti pot helps to adjust the body position so that the water flows out through the lower nostril. When half the water has passed through the nostrils, remove the nozzle from the nostril, centre the head and let the water run out of the nose. Remove any mucus from the nose by blowing gently. Tilt the head to the opposite side and repeat the process, placing the nozzle of the lota in the upper nostril. After completing this process, the nostrils must be thoroughly dried.  Stage  2: Drying the nostrils  1. Stand erect.  Close the right nostril with the right thumb and breathe in and out through the left nostril 10 times in quick succession, as in kapalbhati pranayama.  Repeat through the right nostril, with the left nostril closed. Perform once more through both nostrils.  2. Bend forward from the waist so that the trunk is horizontal.  Repeat the same process as described above, but tilt the head to the right, closing the right nostril.  Repeat again, tilting the head to the left and closing the left nostril.  Finally, repeat again with the head centred, breathing through both nostrils.  Practice             Precautions: The water should only pass through the nostrils. If any water enters the throat or mouth it causes no harm, but indicates that the position of the head needs to be adjusted. Make sure that the nose is properly dried after the practice, otherwise the nasal passages and sinuses may become irritated and manifest the symptoms of a cold.  Only practise neti when necessary. Prolonged practise is not advisable unless instructed by a competent teacher.   Sequence: Jala neti is ideally practised in the morning before asanas and pranayamas. However, if necessary, it may be performed at any time, except after meals.   Duration: This practice should take about 5 minutes.  Neti may be practised daily, once or twice a week, or as required.                               Preparation: A special neti ota, ‘neti pot’ should be used. This pot may be made of plastic, pottery, brass or any other metal which does not contaminate the water. The nozzle on the end of the spout should fit comfortably into the nostril so that the water does not leak out. Even a teapot may be used if the tip of the spout is not too large or sharp. The water should be pure, at body temperature and thoroughly mixed with salt in the proportion of one teaspoonful per half litre of water. The addition of salt ensures the osmotic pressure of the water is equal to that of the body fluids, thereby minimizing any irritation to the mucous membrane. A painful or burning sensation is an indication of too little or too much salt in the water.  Stage  Variations: Practitioners may suck water up the nostrils directly  from a glass or bowl. This is the original form of the practice called vyutkrama kapalbhati, or usha paan, which literally means ‘water of the dawn’. Other liquids may also be used instead of water for the practice of neti. These include warm milk — dugdh neti, warm clarified butter or ghee — ghrita neti, and yoghurt. If oil is used instead of ghee, it must be natural and without added chemicals. The most powerful form of neti is practised with the midflow of one’s own urine, and is known as amaroli neti. This form is particularly useful for alleviating inflammation of the nasal passages. Each liquid bestows a different benefit. None of these variations should be attempted unless instructed by a competent teacher.  492                                                                       ","Awareness: Physical — on relaxing and positioning the body, on the flow of water through the nostrils, and on relaxed breathing through the mouth, especially for beginners. Spiritual - on ajna chakra.  ",,"Benefits: Jala neti removes mucus and pollution from the  nasal passages and sinuses, allowing air to flow without obstruction. It helps prevent and manage respiratory tract diseases. It helps to maintain good health of the ears, eyes and throat. Jala neti relieves muscular tension of the face and helps the practitioner to maintain a fresh and youthful appear- ance. It has a calming and soothing influence on the brain. It alleviates anxiety, anger and depression, removes drowsiness and makes the head feel light and fresh.  49] Jala neti stimulates the various nerve endings in the nose, improving the sense of smell and the overall health of the individual. A balance is brought about between the right and left nostrils and the corresponding left and right brain hemispheres, inducing a state of harmony and balance throughout the bodyand mind. Most importantly, however, neti helps to awaken ajna chakra.  Practice ","Contra-indications: People who suffer from chronic bleeding in the nose should not do jala neti without the advice of a competent teacher. Those who.consistently have great diffi- culty passing water through the nose may have a structural blockage and should seek expert advice. People prone to or having ear infections should not do neti. During colds, flu or sinusitis, when the nose is totally blocked, neti should be avoided.  ",,,,,,
72,JALANDHARA BANDHA," note: Do not exhale or inhale until the chin lock and arm lock have been released and the head is fully upright. If suffocation is felt, end the practice and rest. Once the sensation has passed, resume the practice.  Note. The Sanskrit word jalan means ‘net’ and dhara means ‘stream’  or flow’. One interpretation of jalandhara bandha is the lock which controls the network of nadis in the neck. The physical manifestation of these nadis is the blood vessels and nerves of the neck, An alternative definition is that jal means ‘water’. Jalandhara bandha is therefore the throat lock which holds the nectar or fluid flowing down to vishuddhi from bindu, and prevents it from falling into the digestive fire. In this way, prana is conserved.  475                   Sequence: This bandha is ideally performed in conjunction with mudras, bandhas and pranayamas. If practised on its own, it should be performed after asanas and pranayamas and before meditation.   Duration: Jalandhara bandha can be held for as long as the practitioner is able to comfortably retain the breath. Maintain a count while retaining the breath and gradually increase the count. This practice may be repeated up to 5 times.    Variation: In kriya yoga a more simple and subtle form of jalandhara bandha is practised where the head is simply  473 bent forward so that the chin presses the neck. This variation is commonly used in association with pranayama practices.                                                                                                   ",Awareness: Physical —on the throat pit and sensations con- nected with breath retention.  Spiritual — on vishuddhi chakra.  ,Breathing: The practice is performed during internal re- tention. It may also be performed with external breath retention.  ,"Benefits: The full form of jalandhara bandha compresses the carotid sinuses, which are located on the carotid arteries, the main arteries in the neck. The simple variation exerts a subtler pressure. These sinuses help to regulate the circulatory and respiratory systems. Normally, a decrease in oxygen and increase in carbon dioxide in the body leads to an increased heart rate and heavier breathing. This process is initiated by the carotid sinuses. By exerting pressure on these sinuses, this tendency is prevented, allowing for decreased heart rate and increased breath retention. This practice produces mental relaxation, relieving stress, anxiety and anger. It develops meditative  474 introversion and one-pointedness. The stimulus on the throat helps to balance thyroid function and regulate the metabolism.  Practice ","Contra-indications: People suffering from cervical spon- dylosis, high intracranial pressure, vertigo, high blood pressure or heart disease should not practise jalandhara bandha. Although the neck lock reduces blood pressure, long retention of the breath strains the heart. Jalandhara is the first bandha to be taught as the effects are light and soothing. Refrain from the practice if any vertigo or dizziness arises.  ",,,,,,

Breathing: Exhale while lowering the legs to the sides.  Hold the breath in the final position. Inhale while raising the legs.  ,"Benefits: This asana massages the back, buttocks and hips. It is most useful if done first thing in the moming after waking. Practice Benefits: This asana gives an excellent stretch to the abdominal muscles and organs, and thereby helps to improve diges- tion and eliminate constipation. The twisting stretch of the spinal muscles relieves the strain and stiffness caused by prolonged sitting.  The distance of the feet from the buttocks determines the placement of the spinal twist. If the feet are about 60 cm from the buttocks, the adjustment is in the lower area of the spine. As the feet approach the buttocks, the adjustment rises up the spine. When the feet are next to the buttocks, the adjustment is in the area of the cardiac plexus. Ther- efore, moving the feet about 3 cm each time works on each vertebra, bringing suppleness to the whole spinal column.  56     ",Contra-indications: Not to be performed by persons with serious back conditions. ,,,,,,

82,KAPALBHATI,                                                                                                                      ,,,,,,,,,,
83,KAPALBHATI PRANAYAMA," note: Although kapalbhati is similar to bhastrika, there are important differences. Bhastrika uses force on both inhalation and exhalation, expanding and contracting the lungs above and below their resting or basic volume. Kapalbhati, on the other hand, actively reduces the volume of air in the lungs below this level through forced exha- lation. In this practice, inhalation remains a passive process, which brings the level of air in the lungs back to the basic volume only. Kapalbhati reverses the normal breathing process, which involves active inhalation and passive ex- halation. It has profound effects on the nervous system.  Technique note: If the inhalation seems locked after external retention in maha bandha, a slight exhalation before inhalation relieves the locked condition of the glottis and brings the respiratory muscles back into action.  note: The essence of moorchha pranayama is internal  breath retention. It is possible to slowly develop the capacity to hold the breath for long periods of time. Stopping the breath acts directly on the mind via the pranic body to induce a state of void. The sensation of fainting and light-headedness arises for two reasons. Firstly, pressure on the blood vessels in the neck causes fluctuations in the pressure within the cranial cavity. Secondly, the carotid sinuses, vital to maintaining autonomic control of the body’s circulation, are contin- uously compressed, changing the tone of the autonomic nervous system and inducing a swooning sensation. The practice of antar kumbhaka further reduces the oxygen supply to the brain, especially if held for a long time.  415       |: Preparatory practice (shatkarma method)  Sit in a comfortable meditation asana. The head and spine should be straight with the hands resting on the knees in either chin or jnana mudra.  Close the eyes and relax the whole body.  Exhale through both nostrils with a forceful contraction of the abdominal muscles. The following inhalation should take place passively by allowing the abdominal muscles to relax.  Inhalation should be a spontaneous recoil, involving no effort.  After completing 10 rapid breaths in succession, inhale and exhale deeply. Allow the breath to return to normal. This is one round. Practise up to 5 rounds.    2: Alternate nostrils Sit in a comfortable meditation asana, preferably pad- masana, or siddha/siddha yoni asana. Raise the right hand and perform nasagra mudra.  Left    3: with Antar Kumbhaka (inner retention) After perfecting technique 2, antar kumbhaka may be commenced. At the end of the round, inhale deeply and retain the breath for a comfortable length of time without straining. Exhale slowly with control. Practise up to 5 rounds.  4: with Bahir Kumbhaka (external retention) After perfecting technique 3, bahir kumbhaka may be commenced.  At the end of the round, inhale deeply and retain the breath for a comfortable length of time. Exhale slowly. Retain the breath outside for a comfortable length of time.  Advanced   practice: (addition of bandhas) Before applying bandhas in this practice, they should first be perfected as individual practices. After antar kumbhaka has been mastered, jalandhara and moola bandhas may be combined during internal retention. At the end ofeach round, inhale deeply. Practise jalandhara bandha and then moola bandha during internal retention. Hold the breath inside without straining. After the required count of retention, release moola bandha, jalandhara bandha, and then exhale. practice: (addition of bandhas)  After perfecting maha bandha as an independent practice, it can be incorporated into the practice ofkapalbhati during external reteention.  After completing one round, inhale deeply and retain the  412 breath inside for a few seconds. Exhale completely and practise maha bandha. Retain the bandha, and the breathoutside for a comfortable length of time without straining. Release maha bandha and inhale. Maintain awareness of the eyebrow centre, feeling an all- pervading calmness.    Precaution: Do not practise with bandhas without seeking the guidance of a competent teacher. Precaution: Proceed slowly with awareness of the effects of the practice. Build up the number of breaths, number of rounds and length of retention gradually. Do not strain by practis- ing for extended periods. If breathlessness is experienced, discontinue the practice or reduce the number of rounds to a comfortable level.    Precautions: Kapalbhati should be performed on an empty  stomach, 3 to 4 hours after meals. If practised late at night, it can prevent sleep.  If pain or dizziness are experienced, stop the practice and sit quietly for some time. Practise with more awareness and less force. If the problem continues, consult a com- petent teacher.  Precautions: This technique induces the sensation of light- headedness or swooning. It should only be practised under the guidance of a competent teacher.   Sequence: As a shatkarma to clear excess mucus from the  nasal passages, kapalbhati should be practised before pranayama.  Sequence: Practise just before meditation techniques. Advanced Sequence: After asanas and other pranayamas and before meditation. It is also beneficial before sleep.   Duration: Ten breaths through the left, the right and both nostrils forms one complete round. Practise up to 5 rounds.  411 Duration: Up to 5 rounds. Experienced practitioners can gradually increase the num- ber of respirations to 60, and slowly increase the duration of external retention up to 30 seconds. Further rounds should be practised only under the guid- ance of a competent teacher. Do not strain. Duration: Practise until a fainting sensation is felt.  Note: The Sanskrit word kapal means ‘cranium’ or ‘forehead’ and bhati means ‘light’ or ‘splendour’ and also ‘perception’ or ‘knowl- edge’. Hence kapalbhati is the practice which brings a state of light or clarity to the frontal region of the brain. Another name for this practice is kapalshodhana, the word shodhana mean-  ing ‘to purify’.  413    MOORCHHA PRANAYAMA        Moorchha Pranayama (swooning or fainting breath) Sit in any comfortable meditation asana, preferably padmasana or siddha/siddha yoni asana.

Close the eyes and slowly bring the head back to the upright position. Relax the whole body for a few seconds, keeping the eyes closed. Experience the lightness and tranquillity in the mind and body. This is one round.                 nostril: Close the right nostril with the thumb. Exhale forcefully and inhale passively through the left nostril 10 times. The pumping action should be performed by the abdomen alone; the chest, shoulders and face remain relaxed. After the 10 breaths, take a deep breath in and out through the left nostril.  Right nostril: Close the left nostril and repeat the same process through the right nostril.  Both  nostrils: Replace the raised hand on the knee. Repeat the same process through both nostrils.                                                                                   ","Awareness: Physical - on rhythmic, forceful exhalation.

84,KAPALI ASANA,"   |: Assume kapali asana. Bend the right knee and place the sole of the right foot on the front of the left thigh. The right knee should point forward. Bend the left knee so that the foot points towards the floor behind the body. Hold the final pose for as long as is comfortable. Return to kapali asana and repeat with the opposite leg.  283            Variation 2  Variation   2: Assume kapali asana. Bend the right knee and touch the right buttock with the heel. Tilt the hips forward, bend the left leg and bring the left knee to the chest. The sole of the left foot rests against the right thigh. In the final pose the right knee points forward and the left knee points downward. Hold the final pose for as long as is comfortable. Repeat the practice with the opposite leg.  Other                              details: As for sirshasana, with increased strain on the neck.  284 Balancing Asanas  Balancing asanas develop the functions of the cerebellum, the brain centre that controls how the body works in motion. Most people are uncoordinated in their movements, so their bodies constantly have to compensate for their lack of balance in order to avoid falling or knocking things over. This expends maximum effort and energy for minimum results, creating considerable additional strain. Such people will benefit from this series. However, people with diseases of the cerebellum should not attempt it. Balancing asanas improve muscle coordination and posture, inducing physical and nervous balance, and stilling unconscious movement. This conserves energy and achieves grace and fluidity of motion.  The focus required to perform these asanas with steadiness develops concentration and balance at the emotional, mental and psychic levels, removing stress and anxiety. For relief of excessive tension these practices should be held for as long as comfortable. To steady the mind, practise concentration on one point, at eye or navel level, on the ground, or as indicated in the individual asana — this allows the body to maintain seemingly difficult positions for long periods of time.  Right-handed people will find these asanas are easily learned with the right side leading. They should then be practised with the left side leading to develop both sides equally. Balancing asanas may be difficult to perform at first. However, the body is very adaptable and progress will quickly be made with a few weeks of regular practice. Carefully observe the contra- indications given for individual practices.  285                                                                                         ",,,,,,,,,,

90,KHECHARI MUDRA," note: The advanced hatha yoga form of this practice involves the careful severing of the frenum beneath the tongue so that it can move right into the nasal cavity and stimulate important psychic centres situated there. This form of khechari mudra is not recommended here, as the effects make it unsuitable for interaction with the outside world.               Precaution: Discontinue this mudra if a bitter secretion is tasted. Such a secretion is a sign of toxins in the system.       Duration: Practise for 5 to 10 minutes. Khechari mudra may also be performed with other yoga practices.  435  Note: The word khechari comes from two Sanskrit                                   roots: khe, meaning ‘sky’, and charya, meaning ‘one who moves’. Khechari mudra is associated with amrita, the nectar or elixir of life which 1s secreted  from bindu, a point situated at the posterior fontanel, and then collected at vishuddhi chakra . Perfection of this practice enables the yogi to trap the descending drops of amrita at vishuddhi, overcoming hunger and thirst, and rejuvenating the entire body.  436                                                                  ",Awareness: Physical - on the stretch of the tongue and the light pressure against the upper palate.. Spiritual — at vishuddhi chakra.  ,Breathing: Gradually reduce the respiration rate over a period of months until the number of breaths per minute is 5 or 6. This may be reduced further under the guidance of a competent teacher .  ,"Benefits: Khechari mudra stimulates a number of pressure points located in the back of the mouth and the nasal cavity. These points influence the whole body. A number of glands are also massaged, stimulating the secretion of certain hormones and of saliva. This practice reduces the sensations of hunger and thirst, and induces a state of inner calm and stillness. It preserves the vitality of the body and is especially beneficial for inner healing. Ultimately, this mudra has the potential to stimulate prana and awaken kundalini shakti.

91,KOORMASANA,"                  Sequence: Follow or precede with a backward bending asana such as bhujangasana, matsyasana or supta vajrasana. Poorna dhanurasana is the perfect counterpose for koormasana.   Duration: Hold the pose for up to 3 minutes.  For spiritual purposes, it may be held for longer periods.  Note: This asana induces spontaneous pratyahara, sense with- drawal, which is symbolized by the tortoise. The Bhagavad Gita (2:58) states, “When one can withdraw the senses from association with other objects, as a tortoise withdraws its limbs from external danger, then one 1s firmly fixed on the path towards wisdom.” Koorma means ‘tortoise’, and this posture looks like one too.  327                                                                                                       ","Awareness: Physical-on relaxing the spine, back muscles and abdomen, and on the breath in the final position.

97,MAHA BANDHA," note: Maha bandha can also be performed from utthanpadasana.  Note. The Sanskrit word maha means ‘great’. Maha bandha is called the great lock as it combines all the three bandhas in one practice.  484 Shatkarma                             Precaution: Do not attempt maha bandha until the other three bandhas have been mastered.      Sequence: Maha bandha is ideally performed in conjunction with pranayamas and mudras. If practised on its own, it should be done after asanas and pranayamas and before meditation.   Duration: Once proficiency is attained, increase by one round until 9 rounds can be performed.

When fat or mucus is excessive, the shatkarmas or six cleans- ing techniques should be practised before (pranayama). Others, in whom the doshas (i.e. phlegm, wind and bile) are balanced, need not do them.  Hatha Yoga Pradipika (2:21)       Introduction to Shatkarma  Hz"" yoga, as described in the early Yoga Upanishads,  was made up of the shatkarmas and is a very precise and  systematic science. Shat means ‘six’ and karma means ‘action’; the shatkarmas consist of six groups of purification practices.  The aim of hatha yoga and, therefore, of the shatkarmas is to  create harmony between the two major pranic flows, ida and  pingala, thereby attaining physical and mental purification and balance.  The shatkarmas are also used to balance the three doshas or humours in the  body: kapha, mucus; pitta, bile; and vata, wind. According to both ayurveda and hatha yoga, an imbalance in the doshas will result in illness. These practices are also used before pranayama and other higher yoga practices in order to purify the body of toxins and to ensure safe and successful progression along the spiritual path.  These powerful techniques should never be learned from books or taught by inexperienced people. According to the tradition, only those instructed by a guru may teach others. It is essential to be personally instructed as to how and when to perform the shatkarmas, according to individual limitations and needs.  The six shatkarmas are as follows.  1.  Neti: A process of cleansing and purifying the nasal pas- sages. Practices included in this category  are: jala neti and sutra neti.  2.  Dhauti: A series of cleansing techniques which are divided into three main  groups: antar dhauti or internal cleansing, sirsha dhauti or head cleansing, and hrid dhauti or thoracic  487 cleansing. The dhauti techniques which are given in this section clean the entire alimentary canal from the mouth to the anus. There are four  practices: a) Shankhaprakshalana (varisara dhauti) and laghoo shankha- prakshalana, cleansing of the intestines b) Agnisar kriya (vahnisara dhauti), activating the digestive fire c) Kunjal (vaman dhauti), cleansing the stomach with water d) Vatsara dhauti, cleansing the intestines with air. All of these practices require the guidance of a competent teacher. 3.  Nauli: A method of massaging and strengthening the abdominal organs. 4.  Basti: Techniques for washing and toning the large intes- tine. 5.  Kapalbhati: Abreathing technique for purifying the frontal region of the brain. 6.  Trataka: The practice of intense gazing at one point or object which develops the power of concentration.  Although there are six shatkarmas, each one consists of a variety of practices. In this chapter only the most commonly used practices are described in detail.  Advice, precautions and contra-indications are given for each practice individually and should be carefully observed. During pregnancy, only jala neti and trataka are recommended.  Although the cleansing and strengthening effects of shatkarmas may be beneficial therapeutically, this is not their purpose. Shatkarmas are practices to promote the health of yoga practitioners and to awaken and direct the energies in the body, mind and deeper psyche. People suffering from any medical condition, who wish to utilize any of these practices, should seek the advice of a competent teacher.  The water used in these practices should be pure. If necessary, use an ultraviolet filter or boil the water for several minutes and then allow it to cool to the desired temperature.  488                                                      ","Awareness: Physical - on the perineal, abdominal and throat regions.

100,MAHA VEDHA MUDRA," note: If padmasana has not been mastered this practice can be performed with the legs outstretched, although this method is less effective.  Note. The Sanskrit word maha means ‘great’ and vedha means ‘piercing’. The purpose of maha vedha mudra is to pierce mooladhara chakra and channel the kundalini energy upwards.

If the elbows are too far in front, tension will be felt in the neck; if they are drawn too close to the chest, tension will be felt more in the lower back. Adjust the position of the elbows so that these two points are equally balanced. The ideal position is when the whole spine is equally relaxed. Relax the whole body and close the eyes. After some time, again become aware of the body and surroundings, and gently and smoothly release the posture.

106,MATSYA KRIDASANA," note: A useful suggestion to make the following postures more comfortable is to place a small cushion under the buttocks.                  Precautions: If there is discomfort or pain in the legs after sitting for some time in a meditation asana, slowly unlock the legs and massage them. When the blood circulation has returned to normal and there is no pain, resume the asana. However, be aware that the knee is a very delicate and much abused joint of the body and be careful not to strain it, especially  Swan ok OF Ne  94 while moving into or out of these meditation asanas. Do not on any account use undue force or strain to sit in a meditation asana. Carefully observe the contra-indications given for individual asanas.  Right or left   Duration: Practise this asana for as long as comfortable on both sides. It may also be used for sleeping and resting.   Note: Padmasana may seem out of place in the beginners group. It has been included because a series of asanas in the intermediate group is performed using it as the base position.  95                                         are:  1. Vajrasana (thunderbolt pose)  2. Ananda madirasana (intoxicating bliss pose) 3. Padadhirasana (breath balancing pose)  4, Bhadrasana (gracious pose).  Other asanas, such as gorakhshasana or moola bandhasana, may also be used for meditation, but they are advanced prac- tices and not comfortable for prolonged periods of time. These are described in the advanced asanas chapter.           meditation: “You must be able to sit in one of the meditation asanas for a full three hours at a stretch without the body shaking. Then only will you gain true asana siddhi, mastery over the asana, and be able to practise the higher stages of pranayama and dhyana. Without securing a steady asana, you cannot progress well in meditation. The more steady you are in your asana, the more you will be able to concentrate with a one-pointed mind. If you can be steady ina posture even for one hour, you will be able to acquire a one- pointed mind and feel the atmic anandam, infinite peace and soulful bliss inside you.”  Initially, most people will find it difficult to sit in one asana for a long time. However, through regular practice of the  93 pre-meditation poses listed here, the legs and hips will become flexible enough to comfortably maintain a steady posture.  Pre-meditation  asanas: The following selected practices from the pawanmuktasana series are most useful for preparing the body for the meditation asanas:  . Goolf chakra  . Janu chakra  . Ardha titali asana (half butterfly)  . Shroni chakra (hip rotation)  . Poorna titali (full butterfly)  . Vayu nishkasana (wind releasing pose)  . Udarakarshan asana (abdominal stretch pose)  . Shaithalyasana (animal relaxation pose), refer to chapter on forward bending asanas.   Stillness: When sitting in meditation postures, program the mind with suggestions like, “I am as steady as a rock” or “I am becoming motionless like a statue.” This way the asana will quickly become steady and, after a while, will be comfortable for extended periods of time. This is the practice of kaya sthairyam, complete body stillness.  Alternative  postures: Apart from the postures mentioned in this chapter, there are four other asanas which are useful for meditation. These are described in the chapter on the vajrasana group of asanas. They  leg: In all the asanas discussed in this chapter, either the left or the right leg may be placed uppermost. It is a matter of personal preference and depends on whichever is the more comfortable. Ideally, the leg position should be alter- nated so that the balance on both sides of the body is maintained.  Practice                                               ","Awareness: Physical -on relaxing the whole body, and on the breath.  Spiritual -on manipura chakra.  ",Breathing: Normal and relaxed in the static pose.  ,"Benefits: This asana stimulates digestive peristalsis. It relieves sciatic pain by relaxing the nerves in the legs. People for whom the practice of forward bending asanas is not recom- mended may practise matsya kridasana as a counterpose after backward bending asanas. It relaxes tension in the perineum. In the later months of pregnancy, lying on the back may cause pressure over major veins and block the circulation. In such circumstances, this posture is ideal for relaxing, sleeping or practising yoga nidra. The bent knee and the head may, be supported on a pillow for further comfort.  92 Meditation Asanas  The main purpose of the meditation asanas is to allow the practitioner to sit for extended periods of time without moving the body and without discomfort. Only when the body has been steady and still for some time will meditation be experienced. Deep meditation requires the spinal column to be straight and very few asanas can satisfy this condition. Furthermore, in high stages of meditation the practitioner loses control over the muscles of the body. The meditation asana, therefore, needs to hold the body in a steady position without conscious effort. Why not lie in shavasana, then, for meditation since it satisfies all the requirements? Because in shavasana there is a tendency to drift into sleep. It is essential to remain awake and alert while going through the various stages which lead to successful meditation.  Swami Sivananda of Rishikesh said the following about asanas and ",,,,,,,
107,MATSYASANA," note: It is important that the body is slowly lowered into and raised from the final position by using the elbows as a support. The movement should be performed with control and care as it is very easy to injure the spine.    |: This variation follows the basic technique except for the position of the hands. Interlock the fingers of both hands. Place the hands behind the head and rest the back of the head in the open palms.  Variation   2: (for beginners) Sit with the legs stretched forward. Fold one leg, placing the foot on the opposite thigh as in ardha padmasana, the half lotus pose. Keep the other leg straight in front of the body. Slowly bend backward, using the elbows for support, and lower the crown of the head to the floor. Hold the foot of the bent leg with both hands. Accentuate the arch of the back as muchas possible without straining. Relax the whole body and close the eyes. Remain in the final position for a comfortable length of time and then return to the starting position. Repeat the same pose with the other leg folded. As an alternative, rest the back of the head on the floor instead of the top of the head.  Variation 3           Variation    3: (for beginners) Stretch both legs straight in front of the body. Lean backward, using the arms for support, and rest the top of the head on the floor. Arch the back and place both palms on the thighs or let them rest on the floor. As an alternative, this can be done from the lying position. Return to the starting position after some time in the final position.  187            Sequence: Halasana or sarvangasana are the ideal counter- poses as they stretch the neck in the opposite direction, releasing any muscular tension.   Duration: The final position may be held for up to 5 minutes,  although 1 to 3 minutes is sufficient for general health.   Note: The way of folding the legs in matsyasana resembles the tail of a fish, while the rest of the body represents its body and head.  186 Variation                                                                                                   ","Awareness: Physical — on the abdomen, chest, neck and head or breath.  Spiritual - on manipura or anahata chakra.  ",Breathing: Breathe deeply and slowly in the final position. ,"Benefits: This asana stretches the intestines and abdominal organs and is useful for all abdominal ailments. To remove constipation, drink 3 glasses of water and then perform this asana. It also relieves inflamed and bleeding piles. This practice is very good for asthma and bronchitis as it encourages deep respiration. It recirculates stagnant blood in the back, alleviating backache. It regulates the function of the thyroid gland and stimulates the thymus gland, boosting the immune system.  The pelvic region is given a good stretch and the pressure  of the feet on the thighs greatly reduces blood circulation  in the legs, diverting it to the pelvic organs. Youthfulness and vitality are increased.  Practice ","Contra-indications: People who suffer from heart disease, peptic ulcers, hernia, back conditions or any serious illness should not practise this asana. Pregnant women should also not attempt it.  ",,,,,,
108,MAYURASANA," note: As women have a different muscular system to men in the abdomen and chest areas, they may find mayurasana difficult to perform.  It is very easy to fall forward from the final position and crush the nose on the floor. So be careful and, if necessary, place a small cushion on the floor under the face.                    Sequence: Perform at the end ofan asana session. Mayurasana speeds up the circulation quite vigorously and tends to increase the amount of toxins in the blood as part of the process of purification. Therefore, it should never be practised before any inverted asana as it may direct excess toxins to the brain.   Duration: Up to 3 rounds.

113,MOOLA BANDHA," note: Moola bandha is the contraction of specific muscles in the pelvic floor, not the whole perineum. In the male body, the area of contraction is between the anus and the testes. In the female body, the point of contraction is behind the cervix, where the uterus projects into the vagina. On the subtle level, it is the energizing of mooladhara chakra. The perineal body, which is the convergence of many muscles in the groin, acts as a trigger point for the location of mooladhara chakra. Initially, this area is difficult to isolate, so it is recommended that ashwini and vajroli mudras be performed in preparation for moola bandha.    |: Moola Bandha (perineum contraction)  Stage |: Sit in a comfortable meditative asana, preferably siddha/siddha yoni asana, so that pressure is applied to the perineal/vaginal region.  Close the eyes and relax the whole body.  Be aware of the natural breath.  Focus the awareness on the perineal/vaginal region. Contract this region by pulling up on the muscles of the pelvic floor and then relaxing them.  Continue to briefly contract and relax the perineal/vaginal region as rhythmically and evenly as possible.  Breathe normally throughout the practice.  Stage   2: Continue to breathe normally; do not hold the breath. Slowly contract the perineal/vaginal region and hold the contraction.  Be totally aware of the physical sensation.  Contract a little tighter, but keep the rest of the body relaxed.  Contract only those muscles related to the mooladhara region.  In the beginning the anal and urinary sphincters will also contract, but as greater awareness and control is develop- ed, this will minimize and eventually cease. Ultimately,  476 only one point of contraction will be felt.  Relax the muscles slowly and evenly.  Adjust the tension in the spine to help focus on the point of contraction.  Repeat 10 times with maximum contraction and total relaxation.  Technique 2: with internal breath retention and jalandhara bandha Close the eyes and relax the whole body for a few minutes. Inhale deeply, retain the breath inside and perform jalandhara bandha.  Perform moola bandha and hold the contraction as tightly as possible. Do not strain.  This is the final lock.  Hold the contraction for as long as the breath can comfortably be retained.  Slowly release moola bandha, then jalandhara, raising the head to the upright position, and exhale.  Practise up to 10 times.               Sequence: Moola bandha is ideally performed in conjunction with mudras, bandhas and pranayamas. If practised on its own, it should be performed after asanas and pranayamas and before meditation.    Note: The Sanskrit word moola means ‘root’, ‘firmly fixed’, ‘source’ or ‘cause’. In this context it refers to the root of the spine or the perineum where mooladhara chakra, the seat of kundalini, the primal energy, is located. Moola bandha is effective for locating and awakening mooladhara chakra.  478                                                                                                    ",Awareness: Physical — at the point of perineal contraction.

123,NASIKAGRA DRISHTI,"   |: Preparatory practice It may be difficult at first to focus the eyes on the nosetip. Toovercome this, hold the index finger up at arm’s length from the eyes and focus the gaze upon it. Slowly bring the finger towards the nose, keeping the gaze steadily fixed upon it. When the finger touches the tip of the nose, the eyes should still be focused on the finger. Transfer the focus of the eyes to the nosetip. Eventually this method becomes superfluous and the eyes readily fix on the nosetip at will.  Technique   2: Nasikagra Drishti (nosetip gazing) Sit in any comfortable meditation posture with the head and spine straight. Rest the hands on the knees in chin or jnana mudra.  433 Close the eyes and relax the whole body.  Open the eyes and focus them on the nosetip.  Do not strain the eyes in any way.  When the eyes are correctly focused a refraction of light, forming a V is seen just above the nosetip.  Concentrate on the apex of the V.  Become completely absorbed in the practice to the exclusion of all other thoughts.  After a few seconds, close the eyes and relax them before repeating the practice.  Continue for up to 5 minutes.        practice: Nasikagra drishti may be practised at any time of day, although ideally it is performed early in the morning or late at night before sleep.           Note: The word nasika means ‘nose’, agra means ‘tp’ and drishti means gazing’. Another name for this practice is agochari mudra, which comes from the Sanskrit word agocharam, meaning  434 beyond sensory perception’, ‘unknown’ or ‘invisible’. This mudra, therefore, enables the practitioner to transcend normal awareness. Symbolically, in nasikagra drishti the bridge of the nose is related to the spinal cord. Al the top is the eyebrow centre, ajna chakra, while at the bottom is the nosetip, mooladhara chakra. Just as shambhavi mudra aims to activate ajna chakra by gazing at the eyebrow centre, nasikagra drishti aims to activate mooladhara chakra by gazing at the nosetip.                                                                                                     ","Awareness: Physical — on the muscles of the eyes, and on relaxing them completely between rounds.  Spiritual —- on mooladhara chakra.  Time of ",Breathing: Nasikagra drishti should be practised with normal breathing.  ,"Benefits: Nasikagra drishti is an excellent technique for calming anger and disturbed states of mind.

128,NAULI," note: Madhyama nauli should be perfected before proceeding to vama or dakshina nauli.  Before attempting, nauli the practices of agnisara kriya and uddiyana bandha should be mastered.  When nauli has been perfected in the standing position, it may be practised in siddha/siddha yoni asana.  note: This technique should be learned under the guidance of a competent teacher. A short tube may be inserted into the anus by beginners to make the practice easier.  note: A tumeric root is recommended for this practice because it has a high medicinal value as an antiseptic, blood purifier and general cleanser of physical impurities.  note: Before attempting vyutkrama and sheetkrama kapalbhati, the practitioner should be proficient in the practice of jala neti.    |: Jala Basti (yogic enema with water)  Stand in pure water up to the navel. A flowing river used to be an ideal place.  Lean forward and place the hands on the knees.  Expand the anal sphincter muscles and simultaneously perform uddiyana bandha and nauli in such a way that water is drawn up into the bowels.  Hold the water in the bowels for some time and then expel it through the anus.  |: Vatkrama Kapalbhati (air cleansing) This practice is the same as kapalbhati pranayama, technique 1.  Technique  I: Madhyama Nauli (central abdominal contraction) Stand with the feet about a metre apart. Take a deep breath in through the nose and then exhale through the mouth, emptying the lungs as much as possible. Bend the knees slightly and lean forward, placing the palms of the hands on the thighs just above the knees. The fingers may point either inward or outward. The weight of the upper body should rest comfortably on this area above the knees. The arms should remain straight. Perform jalandhara bandha while maintaining bahir kumbhaka, external breath retention. Keep the eyes open and watch the abdomen.  515 Suck in the lower abdomen  Contract the rectus abdominii muscles, so that they form a central arch, running vertically in front of the abdomen. Contract the muscles as muchas possible, without straining. Hold the contraction for as long as it is comfortable to hold the breath.  Release the contraction, raise the head and return to the upright position.  Inhale slowly and deeply, allowing the abdomen to expand. This is one round.  Relax the whole body in the standing position until the heartbeat returns to normal.  Repeat the practice.        Stage  2: Vama Nauli (left isolation) Follow the instructions for madhyama nauli as described above to the point where the lower abdomen is contracted and the rectus abdominii muscles form a central, vertical arch down the abdomen. Isolate the rectus abdominii muscles at the left side.  516 Contract the muscles to the left side as strongly as possible, without straining.  Return to madhyama naulli.  Release the abdominal contraction, raise the head and return to the upright position.  Inhale slowly and deeply, allowing the abdomen to expand. This is one round.  Relax while standing until the heartbeat returns to normal. Proceed to stage 3.  Stage 2: Sthal Basti (dry yogic enema) Sit with both legs outstretched in front and perform paschimottanasana. Hold the position and perform ashwini mudra 25 times, sucking air into the bowels. Retain the air for some time and then expel it through the anus.  2: Vyutkrama Kapalbhati (sinus cleansing) Fill a bowl with pure warm water and add salt to the ratio of one teaspoon per half litre, ensuring the salt is well dissolved. Stand comfortably and bend over the bowl of water. Relax the whole body as much as possible in this position. Scoop the water up in the palm of the hand and sniff it in through the nostrils. Let the water flow down to the mouth and then expel it. Practise in this way several times. Dry the nostrils properly as described for jala neti. This completes the practice.  Technique    3: Dakshina Nauli (right isolation)  After completing vama nauli, practise the same way but on the right side.  After completing one round, relax in the upright position until the heartbeat returns to normal.  Stage 3: Moola Shodhana (anal cleansing) Insert the soft root of a raw tumeric (haldi) plant gently into the anus. Alternatively, the index or middle finger may be utilized. Rotate the root or the finger around the inner surface of the anal sphincter 10 times clockwise and then 10 times counter-clockwise. Remove the root or the finger and wash the anus with cold water.  3: Sheetkrama Kapalbhati (mucous cleansing) Prepare the water as above.  Stand comfortably and bend over the bowl of water. Take a mouthful of the warm saline water. Instead of swallowing it, however, push it up and expel it through the nose.  Practise in this way several times.  Dry the nostrils as described for jala neti.  This completes the practice.  Time of  4: Abdominal rotation or churning This practice should not be attempted until the previous three stages have been mastered.  Practise vama nauli on the left side, then rotate the muscles to the right, practising dakshina nauli, and back to the left, vama nauli.  Continue rotating the muscles from side to side. This process is known as churning.  Start by practising 3 consecutive rotations, then release the abdominal contraction.  Next start with dakshina nauli first, this time rotating the muscles from right to left, then left to right, 3 times consecutively.  Finally, perform madhyama nauli, isolating the muscles at the centre.  Raise the head and return to the upright position. Inhale slowly and deeply, allowing the abdomen to expand. This is one round.  Relax in the upright position until the heartbeat returns to normal.  Time of   practice: Nauli should be practised only when the stomach is completely empty, at least 5 to 6 hours after meals. The best time to practise is early in the morning before any food or drink is taken.  517 practice: The best time is early in the morning. However, vyutkrama and sheetkrama kapalbhati may be performed at any time of the day except after meals.        Precautions: Nauli should only be practised under the guid- ance of a competent teacher. If any pain is felt in the abdomen during nauli, stop the practice immediately. Try again the following day with more awarenes and less force.    Duration: Start with 5 rounds of madhyama nauli and work up to 10. Vama and dakshina nauli should be performed Duration: Vyutkrama and sheetkrama kapalbhati should take only a few minutes each and may be performed as a weekly routine.   Note: The word nauli comes from the root nala or nali, which means a ‘reed’ or ‘hollow stalk’ and refers to a tubular vessel, vein or nerve of the body. The word nala is the Sanskrit term for the rectus abdominii muscles. Nauli is also known as lauliki karma.  518 The word lauliki is derived from the root lola, meaning ‘to move hither and thither’ or ‘rolling and agitation’, which is exactly what this technique does. It rolls, rotates and agitates the entire abdomen and the associated muscles and nerves.  BAST]  Basti (yogic enema)  Technique Note: The word basti, also widely written as vasti or wasti, is a general term pertaining to the lower abdomen, belly, pelvis and bladder. The technique is also known as basti karma, karma meaning ‘process’ or ‘technique’.  519 Technique Note: The word moola literally means ‘root’ or ‘base’. The word shodhana means ‘purification’. This technique is also known as moola dhauti, and Ganesha kriya or ‘the obstacle removing action’.  520 KAPALBHAT|  Kapalbhati (frontal brain cleansing)  Technique Note: The word kapal means ‘cranium’, ‘forehead’ or ‘frontal lobe of the brain’. Bhati means ‘light’ or ‘splendour’ and also ‘perception’ or ‘knowledge’.  522   Variation: Benefits of basti may also be obtained by sitting in cool, fresh water up to the navel and performing ashwini mudra.                                                       together: 5 to 10 rounds each.  Start abdominal churning with 5 to 10 rotations and slowly increase to 25 rotations over a period of months as more control is gained over the muscles. Do not strain.                                              ",,,"Benefits: Nauli massages and tones the entire abdominal area, including the muscles, nerves, intestines, reproductive, urinary and excretory organs. It generates heat in the body and stimulates appetite, digestion, assimilation, absorption and excretion. It helps to balance the adrenal component of the endocrine system.  Nauli stimulates and purifies manipura chakra, the store- house of prana. It helps to increase mental clarity and power by harmonizing the energy flows in the body.

It holds the trunk and head like a pillar with the legs as the firm foundation. As the body is steadied, the mind becomes calm. This steadi- ness and calmness is the first step towards real meditation. Padmasana directs the flow of prana from mooladhara chakra in the perineum to sahasrara chakra in the head, heightening the experience of meditation. This posture applies pressure to the lower spine, which has a relaxing effect on the nervous system. The breath becomes slow, muscular tension is decreased and blood pressure is reduced.

This activity also stimulates the digestive process.  99  ",Contra-indications: Those who suffer from sciatica or weak or injured knees should not perform this asana.

143,PARIVRITTI JANU SIRSHASANA," note: Assume the postures slowly and gently. Inverted asanas with their counterposes are usually placed at the end of an asana program. Never combine mayurasana with inverted asanas in one practice session.  Right-handed people will find these asanas are easily learned with the right side leading. They should then be practised with the left side leading as a counterbalance.  253               practice: Do not practise inverted asanas until at least three hours after taking food. Do not perform inverted asanas immediately after vigorous exercise.        Precautions: Do not practise near furniture or anything that might impede a free fall to the floor. During a backward or forward fall, aim to break the fall with the feet. While falling, the body should be completely relaxed, never tense. If any discomfort occurs, discontinue the practice.  Cautions for inverted  Sequence: This asana should be practised after forward and backward bending asanas. It is a twisting asana with a forward bend.   Duration: Practise once on each side. Discontinue the pose if any discomfort is experienced.  Duration: Beginners should only remain in the final posi- tions for a few seconds. Once an asana can be maintained without experiencing the slightest difficulty, the duration may be increased gradually until it can be held for the recom- mended time.                                                    asanas: People recovering from operations, or going through pregnancy, people with inflammatory conditions or who are presently infirm, and the elderly, should carefully note the contra-indications for individual asanas, and those cautions and contra-indications given below. They apply to all inverted asanas, not just the ones in this section.  252 Inverted asanas       organs: the liver, spleen, stomach, kidneys and pancreas, receive a powerful massage, helping them to perform their functions more efficiently.  Traditionally, inverted asanas are used to sublimate and transform sexual energy into spiritual energy. The aim of the practices, in this context, is to stimulate the chakras, open  251 sushumna nadi and raise the kundalini to bring about psychic awakening. While it is unlikely that kundalini will be raised through practice of these asanas alone, inverted postures un- doubtedlyimprove the quality of meditation and concentration, refining the consciousness and enabling it to enter unex- plored levels of the mind.  This important group of asanas must be performed cor- rectly and with the utmost care. It is emphasized that these are powerful practices and that the following observances should be strictly adhered to.  Time of  Equipment: Always practise these asanas on a folded blan- ket or yoga mat thick enough to protect the vertebrae of the neck and back of the head. Never practise on a soft mattress, spring bed or cushions.   Rest: Always follow inverted poses with shavasana. Rest until the breath and heartbeat are completely normal, then practise the recommended counterpose.   include:  1. Semi-inverted positions where the trunk and head are horizontal, but the feet are raised above the head, e.g. poorwa halasana. Generally, they are not so challenging, but more care is needed if they are also strenuous practices, e.g. padotthanasana when performed with both legs raised.  2. Semi-inverted positions where the head is below the trunk, where the contra-indications must be fully observed, e.g. pada hastasana, and more so if the asanas are also strenuous, e.g. sirshapada bhumi sparshasana.  3. Fully inverted positions such as sarvangasana or sirshasana, which again may be strenuous, e.g. vrikshasana                                         ",Awareness: Physical - on the twist and stretch of the body. Spiritual - on manipura chakra.  ,"Breathing: Breathe normally while positioning the legs. Exhale while inclining the trunk and placing the arms and hands into position, then inhale.  Exhale while pulling the body sideways. Breathe normally while holding the final position. Inhale while returning to the upright position.  ","Benefits: This asana gives a lateral stretch to the body, and also stretches the hamstrings and behind the shoulders. It gives a beneficial compression of the abdominal muscles and organs on one side of the body and simultaneously stretches them on the other side. It prepares the body for long hours of sitting in meditation asanas.  250 Inverted Asanas  Inverted asanas reverse the action of gravity on the body; instead of everything being pulled towards the feet, the orien- tation shifts towards the head. Similarly, on the emotional and psychic levels, inverted asanas change the normal patterns, throwing a new light on old patterns of behaviour and being. Generally, these practices are refreshing and revitalizing. They improve health, reduce anxiety and stress, and increase self- confidence. They also increase mental power, concentration and the capacity to sustain large workloads without strain.  Inverted asanas encourage blood to flow to the brain, nour- ishing the neurones and flushing out toxins. Blood and lymph, accumulated in the lower limbs, pelvis and abdomen, are drained back to the heart, then circulated to the lungs, puri- fied and re-circulated to all parts of the body. This process nourishes the cells of the whole human organism. The en- riched blood flow also allows the pituitary gland to operate more efficiently, tuning the entire endocrine system. This has a positive effect on the metabolic processes and even on ways of thinking.  While the body is in an inverted asana, the breath becomes slow and deep, maximizing the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen, and generally encouraging correct respiration.

Contra-indications: People suffering from heart conditions,  high blood pressure or back conditions, especially slipped disc, should not practise these asanas. Those with illnesses that make the blood impure should not perform inverted asanas until the blood is purified. People with arteriosclerosis, glaucoma, an active ear infection or any disease of the brain should refrain from inverted postures.

169,SHAMBHAVI MUDRA," note: Shambhavi mudra is a powerful technique for awakening ajna chakra and is a meditation practice in its own right. It may produce profound experiences and should only be performed under the guidance of a com- petent teacher. Shambhavi mudra is also incorporated in asanas such as simhasana, the lion pose.  432 Note. Shambhavi mudra is a means of attaining higher awareness and inducing higher consciousness within the practitioner. The practice is also known as bhrumadhya drishti; bhru means ‘eyebrow centre’ and drishti means ‘gazing’, hence this is the practice of eyebrow centre gazing.             practice: (internal shambhavi mudra)  Once shambhavi mudra has been mastered with the eyes open, it may be performed with the eyes closed. This is a more powerful practice because the awareness is more internalized. Be careful not to lose awareness of the eyebrow centre during the practice. Always ensure that the inner gaze is directed upward, although the eyes are closed.  Practice       Precautions: The eyes are very sensitive and consequently the final position should not be held for too long. If the nerves are weak, any strain can cause retinal detachment. Release the position when strain is experienced.    Duration: Start with 5 rounds and gradually increase to 10 rounds over a period of months.

170,SHANMUKHI MUDRA," note: Shanmukhi mudra is a practice used in nada yoga to hear any internal manifestation of sound in the region of bindu chakra. There may be many sounds or none at all; just listen. Do not expect to hear subtle sounds immediately; practice is necessary. At first there may be no sound or a confused jumble of sounds. Upon hearing one distinct sound, focus the awareness totally upon it. This may take a few weeks of practice. As sensitivity develops, subtler sounds will be heard.  Shanmukhi mudra is also used to enhance visualization in other branches of yoga such as swara yoga, tattwa shuddhi and kriya yoga.  445           practice: Shanmukhi mudra is best practised early in the morning or late at night when there is maximum quiet. Practising at this time awakens psychic sensitivity.          Duration: Practise for 5 minutes to begin with. Gradually build the duration up over a period of months to 30 minutes.   Note: The word shanmukhi is comprised of two                                   roots: shat means ‘six’ and mukhi means ‘gates’ or ‘faces’. Shanmukhi mudra involves redirecting the awareness inside by closing the six doors of outer                           perception: the two eyes, the two ears, the nose and the mouth. This practice is also known as baddha yoni asana, the locked source pose; devi mudra, attitude of the great goddess; parangmukhi mudra, the gesture of inner focusing; and sambhava mudra, the gesture of equipoise.

180,SIDDHASANA," note: Siddhasana may be performed with either leg uppermost. Many people experience discomfort due to the pressure applied where the ankles cross each other. If necessary, place a folded cloth or piece of sponge between the legs at this point. At first the pressure at the perineum may be uncomfortable to maintain, but with practice this will be eased.  101 Note. The Sanskrit word siddha means power’ and ‘perfection’. The word siddhi is derived from siddha and refers to a psychic power or faculty developed through yogic practices. Siddhis include clairvoyance and telepathy as well as many other lesser known powers such as the ability to disappear at will. Siddhasana, or siddha yoni asana for women, is believed to be the asana that helps develop these powers.  SIDDHA YONI ASANA        Siddha Yoni Asana (accomplished pose for women) Sit with the legs straight in front of the body. Bend the right leg, placing the sole of the foot flat against the inner left thigh and the heel firmly against the groin. Adjust the body position so that there is comfortable pressure of the right heel. Bend the left leg and wedge the left toes down into the space between the right calf and thigh. Grasp the toes of the right foot and pull them up into the space between the left calf and thigh. The left heel is above the right heel and may exert a light pressure against the public bone.  102 Again adjust the position so that it is comfortable. Ensure that the knees are firmly on the ground. Make the spine fully erect and straight as though it were planted solidly in the earth. Place the hands on the knees is chin, jnana or chinmaya mudra. Close the eyes and relax the whole body.                    Note: The Sanskrit word yoni means ‘womb’ or ‘source’.                                                                                                     ",,,"Benefits: Siddhasana directs the energy from the lower psychic  centres upward through the spine, stimulating the brain and calming the entire nervous system. The position of the lower foot at the perineum presses mooladhara chakra, stimulating moola bandha, and the pressure applied to the pubic bone presses the trigger point for swadhisthana, automatically activating vajroli/sahajoli mudra. These two psycho-muscular locks redirect sexual nervous impulses back up the spinal cord to the brain, establishing control over the reproductive hormones which is necessary in order to maintain brahmacharya for spiritual purposes. Prolonged periods in siddhasana result in noticeable tingling sensations in the mooladhara region, which may last for ten to fifteen minutes. This is caused by a reduction in the blood supply to the area and by a rebalancing of the pranic flow in the lower chakras. This posture redirects blood circulation to the lower spine and abdomen, toning the lumbar region of the spine, the pelvis and the abdominal! organs, and balancing the reproductive system and the blood pressure.

After a few minutes, open the eyes, bend forward and place the forearms on a folded blanket with the fingers interlocked and the elbows in front of the knees. The distance between the elbows should be equal to the distance from each elbow to the interlocked fingers, forming an equilateral triangle.

188,SUKHASANA," note: Sukhasana is a relaxing posture which may be used after extended periods of sitting in siddhasana or padmasana.  Although sukhasana is said to be the simplest meditation posture, it is difficult to sustain for long periods of time unless the knees are close to the ground or on the ground.

While slowly inhaling, return to the base position. Relax the body. Repeat 3 times with the right leg and then 3 times with the left leg.  Practice   2: Remain in the starting position.  Bend both knees and bring the thighs to the chest. Interlock the fingers and clasp the hands on the shin bones just below the knees.  Inhale deeply.  Exhaling, raise the head and shoulders and try to place the nose in the space between the two knees.  Hold the raised position for a few seconds, counting mentally.  Slowly lower the head, shoulders and legs while inhaling. Practise this 3 times.      4: Supta Pawanmuktasana (leg lock pose)  Stage                                                                                                              ","Awareness: On the movement, the abdominal pressure, and the breath.  ",,"Benefits: Supta pawanmuktasana strengthens the lower back muscles and loosens the spinal vertebrae. It massages the abdomen and the digestive organs and is therefore very effective in removing wind and constipation. By massaging the pelvic muscles and reproductive organs, it is also useful for impotence, sterility and menstrual problems.  53     ",Contra-indications: Not to be performed by persons suffering from high blood pressure or serious back conditions such as sciatica and slipped disc.  ,,,,,,
190,SUPTA VAJRASANA," note: Never leave the final position by straightening the legs first, as this may dislocate the knee joints. Return to vajrasana first and then straighten the legs.           note: Never leave the final position by straightening the legs first, as this may dislocate the knee joints. Return to vajrasana first and then straighten the legs.  Note. The Sanskrit word supta means ‘sleeping’ and vajra refers to the nerve and energy pathway which connects the sexual organs to the brain.  136 Standing Asanas  This series of asanas has a stretching and strengthening effect on the back, shoulders and leg muscles. They are particularly useful for those who spend a lot of time sitting down or who have stiffness or pain in the back. They improve posture, balance and muscular coordination. They also strengthen the muscles used to keep the back straight during meditation and increase oxygenation and lung capacity. Those who suffer from sciatica or slipped disc may practise hasta utthanasana, akarna dhanurasana and tadasana, but should not practise any of the other standing asanas except under the guidance of a competent teacher. Carefully observe the specific contra-indi- cations for each practice.  Right-handed people will find these asanas are easily learned with the right side leading. They should then be practised with the left side leading to counterbalance the effect of habitual behaviour patterns.  137                      Sequence: Follow supta vajrasana with a forward bending asana. The most convenient counterpose is shashankasana since it may be performed immediately from vajrasana without unnecessary body movement.   Duration: Beginners should start with only a few seconds in the final position, increasing the duration slowly. For physical benefits, up to one minute is sufficient.  For spiritual benefits, practise for longer periods.    Variation: The back of the head, instead of the top, is placed on the floor in the final position.  Join the hands together and place them under the back of the head, or fold the arms comfortably above the head. Try to keep the knees on the floor.  Close the eyes and relax the whole body.                                                                                                   ","Awareness: Physical — on the crown of the head, neck, lower back, abdomen or breath.  Spiritual — on swadhisthana, anahata or vishuddhi chakra.  ",Breathing: Deep and slow.  Breathing: Deep and slow in the final position.  ,"Benefits: This asana massages the abdominal organs, alleviat- ing digestive ailments and constipation. It tones the spinal nerves, makes the back flexible and realigns rounded shoulders. The nerves in the neck and the thyroid gland are particularly influenced. The chest is stretched and expanded to full capacity, filling the lungs and bringing more oxygen into the system. It is beneficial for those suffering from asthma, bronchitis and other lung ailments. It loosens up the legs in preparation for sitting in medit- ation asanas. It redirects sexual energy to the brain for spiritual purposes.  Practice Benefits: This is an important variation which intensifies the stretch of the abdominal region, without placing pressure on the neck.  Practice ","Contra-indications: This posture should not be practised by people suffering from neck problems, sciatica, slipped disc, sacral ailments or knee complaints.  135 ",,,,,,
191,SURYA BHEDA PRANAYAMA," note: The effect of chin or jnana mudras is very subtle and it requires great sensitivity on the part of the practitioner to perceive the change in consciousness established. With practice, however, the mind becomes conditioned to the mudra and when it is adopted, the signal to enter a meditative state is transmitted.  Note. The word jnana means ‘wisdom’ or ‘knowledge’, and thus jnana mudra is the gesture of intuitive knowledge. Chin, on the other hand, is derived from the word chit or chitta, which means ‘consciousness’. Chin mudra, therefore, is the psychic gesture of consciousness.  Symbolically, the small, ring and middle fingers represent the three gunas or qualities of nature. tamas, stability; rajas, activity  426 and creativity; and sattwa, luminosity and harmony. In order for consciousness to pass from ignorance to knowledge, these three states must be transcended. The index finger represents individual consciousness, the jivatma, while the thumb symbolizes supreme consciousness. In jnana and chin mudras the individual (index finger) is bowing down to the supreme consciousness (the thumb), acknowledging its unsurpassed power. The index finger, however, is touching the thumb, symbolizing the ultimate unity of the two experiences and the culmination of yoga.       2: with Antar Kumbhaka (inner retention) At the end of inhalation close both nostrils. Maintain the internal retention for a comfortable length of time. Exhale slowly through the right nostril, keeping the left nostril closed with the ring finger. Slowly increase the duration of the inhalation, retention and exhalation without straining.  Advanced       practice: (addition of bandhas) Before applying jalandhara and moola bandhas with antar kumbhaka, they should be perfected as individual practices. Perform jalandhara and then moola bandha after the inhalation. Hold for a comfortable length of time. Release moola bandha, then jalandhara and slowly raise the head. When the head is upright, exhale slowly through the right nostril.        Precautions: Never practise surya bheda pranayama after eating, as it will interfere with the natural flow of energy associated with digestion.  This pranayama may cause imbalance in the breathing cycle if performed for prolonged periods.  Surya bheda is a very powerful pranayama and should only be performed under the guidance of a competent teacher.  Do not practise pranayama with bandhas without the guidance of a competent teacher.   Sequence: One of these two mudras should be adopted when- ever practising meditation, unless otherwise specified.   Duration: When first practising surya bheda pranayama, 10 rounds are sufficient. Over time, however, as the practice becomes comfortable, the duration may be increased to 10  416 minutes. Slowly increase the length of retention over a matter of months.  Aratio of 1:1:1 may be introduced to stabilize the practice. Once this is mastered, it may be increased to 1:1:2 and then 1:2:2.   Note: The Sanskrit word surya means ‘sun’, which refers to pingala nadi, while bheda means ‘to pierce’, ‘pass through’ or ‘awaken’. Surya bheda, then, means to pierce or purify pingala nadi.  417               TeMadwaes Vatefagtgethy | SENS Yat Berard Paraty 03:4  Tasmaatsarvaprayatnena prabodhayitumeeshvareem. Brahmadvaaramukhe suptaam mudraabhyaasam samaacharet.  Therefore, the goddess sleeping at the entrance of Brahma’s door should be constantly aroused with all effort, by per- forming mudra thoroughly.  Hatha Yoga Pradipika (3:5)       Introduction to Mudra  he Sanskrit word mudra is translated as ‘gesture’ or  ‘attitude’. Mudras can be described as psychic, emotional, devotional and aesthetic gestures or attitudes. Yogis have experienced mudras as attitudes of energy flow, intended to link individual pranic force with universal or cosmic force. The Kularnava Tantra traces the word mudra to the root mud, meaning ‘delight’ or ‘pleasure’, and dravay, the causal form of dru, which means ‘to draw forth’. Mudra is also defined as a ‘seal’, ‘short-cut’ or ‘circuit by-pass’.  Mudras are a combination of subtle physical movements which alter mood, attitude and perception, and which deepen awareness and concentration. A mudra may involve the whole body in a combination of asana, pranayama, bandha and visualization techniques, or it may be a simple hand position. The Hatha Yoga Pradipika and other yogic texts consider mudra to be a yoganga, an independent branch of yoga, requiring a very subtle awareness. Mudras are introduced after some proficiency has been attained in asana, pranayama and bandha, and gross blockages have been removed.  Mudras have been described in various texts from antiquity to the present day in order to preserve them for posterity. However, such references were never detailed or clearly delineated as these techniques were not intended to be learned from a book. Practical instruction from a guru was always considered to be a necessary requisite bef ore attempting them. Mudras are higher practices which lead to awakening of the pranas, chakras and kundalini, and which can bestow major siddhis, psychic powers, on the advanced practitioner.  421 Mudras and prana The attitudes and postures adopted during mudra practices establish a direct link between annamaya kosha, the physical body, manomaya kosha, the mental body and pranamaya kosha, the energy body. Initially, this enables the practitioner to develop awareness of the flow of prana in the body. Ultimately, it establishes pranic balance within the koshas and enables the redirection of subtle energy to the upper chakras, inducing higher states of consciousness.  Mudras manipulate prana in much the same way that energy in the form of light or sound waves is diverted by a mirror or a cliff face. The nadis and chakras constantly radiate prana which normally escapes from the body and dissipates into the external world. By creating barriers within the body through the practice of mudra, the energy is redirected within. For example, by closing the eyes with the fingers in shanmukhi mudra, the prana being radiated through the eyes is reflected back. In the same way, the sexual energy emitted through vajra nadi is redirected to the brain through the practice of vajroli mudra.  Tantric literature states that once the dissipation of prana is arrested through the practice of mudra, the mind becomes introverted, inducing states of pratyahara, sense withdrawal, and dharana, concentration. Because of their ability to redirect prana, mudras are important techniques for awakening kundalini. For this reason they are incorporated extensively in kriya and kundalini yoga practices.  A scientific look at mudras  In scientific terms, mudras provide a means to access and influence the unconscious reflexes and primal, instinctive habit patterns that originate in the primitive areas of the brain around the brain stem. They establish a subtle, non-intellectual connection with these areas. Each mudra sets up a different link and has a correspondingly different effect on the body, mind and prana. The aim is to create fixed, repetitive postures and gestures which can snap the practitioner out of instinctive habit patterns and establish a more refined consciousness.  422 FIVE GROUPS OF YOGA MUDRAS  The yoga mudras can be categorized into approximately five groups, which are described as follows.  1. Hasta (hand mudras)  The hand mudras presented in this book are meditative mudras. They redirect the prana emitted by the hands back into the body. Mudras which join the thumb and index finger engage the motor cortex at a very subtle level. They generate a loop of energy which moves from the brain down to the hand and then back again. Conscious awareness of this process rapidly leads to internalization. Techniques included in this category  Variation: Jnana and chin mudras are often performed with the tip of the thumb and index finger touching and forming a circle. Beginners may find this variation less secure for prolonged periods of meditation, as the thumb and index finger tend to separate more easily when body awareness is lost. Otherwise, this variation is as effective as the basic position.  Practice                                       are:  Jnana mudra  Chin mudra  Yoni mudra  Bhairava mudra  Hridaya mudra.  2. Mana (head mudras)  These practices form an integral part of kundalini yoga and many are meditation techniques in their own right. They utilize the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and lips. Techniques included in this category are:  Shambhavi mudra  Nasikagra drishti  Khechari mudra  Kaki mudra  Bhujangini mudra  Bhoochari mudra  Akashi mudra  Shanmukhi mudra  Unmani mudra.  5. Kaya (postural mudras)  These practices utilize physical postures combined with breathing and concentration. Techniques included in this category are:  423 Vipareeta karani mudra Pashinee mudra  Prana mudra  Yoga mudra  Manduki mudra Tadagi mudra.  4. Bandha (lock mudras) These practices combine mudra and bandha. They charge the system with prana and prepare it for kundalini awakening. Techniques included in this category are:  Maha mudra  Maha bheda mudra  Maha vedha mudra.  5. Adhara (perineal mudras) These techniques redirect prana from the lower centres to the brain. Mudras concerned with sublimating sexual energy are in this group. Techniques included in this category are: Ashwini mudra Vajroli/sahajoli mudra.  Between them these five groups engage substantial areas of the cerebral cortex. The comparatively large number of head and hand mudras reflects the fact that the operation and interpretation of information coming in from these two areas occupies approximately fifty percent of the cortex.  Mudras are performed either in combination with or after asana and pranayama. The mudras presented in this book represent a small selection of those discussed in the yogic texts.  424    JNANA AND CHIN MUDRAS  asy  Jnana Mudra (psychic gesture of knowledge) Assume a comfortable meditation posture. Fold the index fingers so that they touch the inside root of the thumbs. Straighten the other three fingers of each hand so that they are relaxed and slightly apart. Place the hands on the knees with the palms facing down. Relax the hands and arms.  BSY ©  Chin Mudra (psychic gesture of consciousness) Chin mudra is performed in the same way as jnana mudra, except that the palms of both hands face upwards, with the backs of the hands resting on the knees. Relax the hands and arms.                                                             ",Awareness: On the breath in the right nostril.  ,,"Benefits: This practice creates heat in the body and counteracts imbalances of the vata (wind) and kapha (phlegm) doshas (humours). It stimulates and awakens the pranic energy by activating pingala nadi. By increasing extroversion and dynamism, it enables physical activities to be performed more efficiently and helps to alleviate depression. It is especially recommended for those who are dull and lethargic or who find it difficult to communicate with the external world. It makes the mind more alert and perceptive and is an excellent pre-meditation pranayama.  Benefits: Jnana mudra and chin mudraare simple but impor- tant psycho-neural finger locks which make meditation asanas more powerful. The palms and fingers of the hands  425 have many nerve root endings which constantly emit energy. When the index finger touches the thumb, a circuit is produced which allows the energy that would normally dissipate into the environment to travel back through the body and up to the brain.  When the fingers and handsare placed on the knees, the knees are sensitized, creating another pranic circuit that maintains and redirects prana within the body. In addition, placing the hands on the knees stimulates a nadi which runs from the knees, up the inside of the thighs and into the perineum. This nadi is known as gupta or the hidden nadi. Sensitizing this channel helps to stimulate the energies at mooladhara chakra.  When the palms face upward in chin mudra, the chest area is opened up. The practitioner may experience this as a sense of lightness and receptivity, which is absent in the practice of jnana mudra.  ","Contra-indications: People suffering from heart disease, hypertension, epilepsy, hyperthyroid, peptic ulcer, acidity or anxiety should not practise this pranayama.  ",,,,,,

193,SUTRA NETI," note: Although the catheter is easier and quicker, it does not clean the nasal passages as effectively as the cotton thread. Technique 2 is possible with some types of catheter only.  495    SHANKHAPRAKSHALANA  Technique note: The five asanas which form the core of the practice activate intestinal peristalsis and enhance the cleansing process. When performed in the correct sequence, they progressively open the pyloric valve at the outlet of the stomach, then the ileocaecal valve at the exit of the small intestine and finally the sphincter which forms the anus. Tadasana acts mainly on the stomach and stretches the colon; tiryaka tadasana acts on the small intestine and colon; kati chakrasana massages the small intestine; tiryaka bhujangasana and udarakarshanasana squeeze and mas- sage the caecum, sigmoid colon and rectum, and also stimulate the urge to defecate. Those who have difficulty drinking rapidly or develop a feeling of nausea should reduce the quantity of water from two to one glass before each round. The quantity of salt may also be reduced.  Note. The word shankhaprakshalana comes from two note: Greater benefits may be derived by combining this practice with light food. Medication may be safely continued.  Technique   |: Basic practice Take any comfortable standing, sitting or squatting position. Relax the whole body. Tilt the head slightly back. Gently and slowly insert the narrow end of the catheter or waxed end of the thread into whichever nostril is flowing more freely.  493 As the thread is inserted, twist it so that it enters the nostril easily. Always keep the tip pointing downward towards the base of the nose. Never push the catheter straight up because the nasal cavity is behind the nose, not at the top of the nose.  When the thread reaches the back of the throat, insert the index finger and thumb, or the middle and index fingers, into the mouth.  Pull the catheter or thread gently and slowly out through the mouth, leaving a few inches of thread hanging out of the nostril.  This action may cause retching at first, but it will become easier with practice.  Hold each end of the sutra or catheter with the fingers. Very slowly and gently pull it backward and forward, no more than 15 times on the first attempt.  Remove it slowly through the nose and repeat the process with the opposite nostril.  Technique |: Shankhaprakshalana or Varisara Dhauti (cleansing of the entire digestive tract)   2: Advanced practice After completing technique 1, leave the thread with one end passing through the mouth and the other through the nostril. Gently insert the waxed end emerging from one nostril into the other nostril and pull the end through the mouth. In the final position, both waxed ends emerge from the mouth. Loosen the hard wax at the tip of each end so that the individual strands again become separated. Push the two ends together so that they merge with one another, and twist the thread so that the two ends become joined. If the join is too thick, some of the threads may be cut away so that the join may pass easily through the nostrils. The thread is now circular. Slowly draw the join into the mouth, progressively sliding the thread through the nostrils. Eventually the join should be located between the entrance to the two nostrils. Disconnect the join.  494 The thread now enters one nostril and emerges from the other; it no longer passes through the mouth.  Gently pull the sutra to and fro, a few times only to begin with. If there is the slightest discomfort, stop the practice immediately.  Pull one end of the thread and slowly withdraw it from the nose.  2: Laghoo Shankhaprakshalana (short intestinal wash)  Two litres of warm salted water should be prepared as for poorna shankhaprakshalana  Quickly drink 2 glasses of the prepared water.  Perform the following 5 asanas 8 times    3: TTK solution One litre of warm salted water should be prepared as for shankhaprakshalana, or pure unsalted water at room temperature can be used if the weather is not too cold. The first 3 asanas of the shankhaprakshalana series are    practice: The best place to practise shankhaprakshalana is in an ashram, in an open area where there is plenty of fresh air. Ensure that adequate toilet facilities are nearby.  The practice is best undertaken with a group of people. The atmosphere should be relaxed, friendly and light- hearted, with no apprehension concerning the practice, as this can create tension and prevent free bowel movement.  498 practice: Laghoo should be practised in the morning when the stomach is completely empty, before any food or drink is taken.  practice: The TTK solution should be practised in the morning when the stomach is completely empty, before any food or drink is taken and before other asanas.        Precautions: Do not use force under any circumstances. The interior of the nose is very delicate and any undue force could cause damage. After persistent attempts, if the thread or catheter will not pass through the nose, consult a competent teacher. Make sure that the sutra is perfectly clean before inserting it into the nostril. It is best not to try sutra neti until jala neti has been perfected.  Precautions: It is important not to exceed the point beyond which almost clear water without specks of solid matter is being passed, as the system may start producing bile, indicated by bright yellow water. It is better to stop when thewater is still slightly cloudy. While resting for 45 minutes after terminating the practice, one should not sleep as a headache or cold may result.  No water or other fluids should be taken until at least 2 hours after the first special meal. Cold liquid will chill the digestive system. Drinking or eating anything before the prescribed period will dilute and wash away the new protective layer which is being reproduced by the body on the stomach and intestinal wall.  Fans and air-conditioning should not be used until the evening as the body must be kept warm to prevent chills and fever. If the room is cool, the body should be covered with a blanket to maintain the inner body temperature. Sitting in the hot sun, near a fire or doing physical exercise should be avoided.  Rest periods should be maintained very carefully.  Mental strain and stressful situations should be avoided.  Food Precautions: Do not try to force a bowel movement; it should be completely natural.  Precautions: Do not try to force a bowel movement; it should be completely natural.   Sequence: Sutra neti should be performed before jala neti as the latter will flush out all the impurities and particles in the nose which have been dislodged by sutra neti.   Duration: The practice takes about 10 minutes.  Once every few days or once a week is sufficient.  Duration: The whole day should be put aside for this practice and the following day for rest.  Duration: Allow an hour for this practice.                               Preparation: This practice involves passing a length of cotton thread through the nose. Traditionally, a specially pre- pared cotton thread, sutra, was used. Several strands were tightly wrapped together and dipped in melted beeswax. The width was about 4 mm and the length 36 to 45 cm. Nowadays, however, the practice is more conveniently performed by using a thin, rubber catheter lubricated with melted ghee, butter, edible oil or one’s own saliva, so that it slides easily through the nasal passage. The size of the catheter depends on the individual nasal passage. Beginners may prefer size 4, but progress to size 6.  Technique Preparation: It is advisable to take a light, semi-liquid meal the night before undertaking this practice. Plenty of clean, lukewarm water should be available and also extra hot water in case the temperature of the water cools. Add 2 teaspoons of salt per litre to the water, so that it tastes mildly salty. Prepare a special khichari of good quality white rice and mung dal, cooked with ghee, clarified butter. The rice and lentils should be cooked together in water until soft. A little haldi, turmeric, may be added, but no salt. Finally, the clarified butter should be liberally mixed in so that the final preparation is semi-liquid. The khichari should be eaten at the end of the practice, after a 45-minute rest period, and again later in the day. No asana or physical work should be performed, and no food or beverages should be taken before commencing the practice. Not evacuating the bowels prior to the practice helps stimulate the peristaltic movement. Light and comfortable clothing should be worn. Complete intestinal               practices: Kunjal kriya followed by jala neti may be performed 10 minutes after completing the internal wash.  practices: Kunjal kriya and jala neti may be per- formed immediately after completing the practice.  Time of                Rest: Total rest is essential after completion of the practice. Do not take a shower or bathe.  Lie down in shavasana for 45 minutes, but do not sleep as a headache or cold may result. It is important to keep warm during this resting period. Try to maintain mouna, silence. During this time the whole digestive system is given a chance to revitalize itself.  Passing urine at this time is perfectly normal.  Special Rest: On completion of the practice, rest for half an hour before taking any food or drink.      words: shankha, meaning ‘conch’, and prakshalana, meaning ‘to wash completely’. The word shankha is intended to represent and describe the intestines with their cavernous and coiled shape. Traditionally, this practice was known as varisara dhauti, but nowadays it is better known as shankhaprakshalana. The word varisara comes from two words: vari, meaning ‘water’, and sara, meaning ‘essence’. This practice is also a part of kaya kalpa, which is an ayurvedic technique for physical purification and transformation, kaya meaning body’ and kalpa, ‘transformation’.  501 Technique   wash: Drink 2 glasses of warm salty water as quickly as possible. Perform the following 5 asanas dynamically, 8 times each in the following sequence. a) Tadasana b) Tiryaka tadasana c) Kati chakrasana (variation) d) Tiryaka bhujangasana e) Udarakarshanasana. This is one complete round. Do not rest between rounds. Drink 2 more glasses of warm salty water and again repeat the 5 asanas 8 times each.  496 Repeat this process a third time.  After the third round, go to the toilet and see if there is any movement in the bowels, if they have not yet been emptied. Do not strain.  Resume the practice, regardless of whether there has been any movement or not; it is not essential at this point. Drink 2 more glasses and repeat the 5 asanas 8 times. Again go to the toilet, but do not use force to produce a bowel movement.  Continue drinking the water, performing the asanas and going to the toilet, allowing the pressure to build up. Spend as little time in the toilet as possible, a minute or so is enough. The aim is to build up the internal cleansing pressure.  At first solid stool will be evacuated, followed by a mixture of stool and water. As the practice progresses, more water and less solid stool will be excreted. Eventually, cloudy yellow water and, finally, almost clear water will be evacuated.  Sixteen glasses are generally required before clear water is evacuated, but it varies from person to person.  The speed at which one completes the practice should not be compared with that of others.  The practice should be performed in a relaxed way at one’s own pace.  Supplementary  meal: Exactly 45 minutes after completing shankha- prakshalana the specially prepared khichari must be taken.  497 Eating this meal at the correct time is essential. The rhythm of the body has been temporarily disturbed; however, 45 minutes after completion of the practice the digestive functions resume.  The three components of khichari are helpful in the restoration of correct digestive function. The clarified butter is necessary to coat the intestinal walls until the body produces a new lining. The rice provides a simple, easily digestible packing material in the form of carbohydrate, and creates mucus, which also protects the inner lining of the alimentary canal. The lentils supplement the diet by giving the body an easily digestible source of protein, and make for an all-round nutritious meal.  A sufficient quantity of khichari must be eaten to reline the intestines and keep the walls of the gut stretched, otherwise they may cramp due to the absence of the bulk to which they are accustomed. This bulk not only maintains the tone, but aids the intestines to resume peristalsis. It is also important in order to prevent indigestion, diarrhoea, and constipation.  Further meal: Khichari should also be prepared for the late afternoon or evening meal, about 6 hours after the first special meal. The stomach must be filled to capacity at both meals, even if there is no feeling of hunger.  Place of  rest: Having eaten, further rest is necessary. However, it is important not to sleep for at least three hours after the initial meal. Sleep during this period may lead to physical lethargy and headache. Complete rest should be taken for the remainder of the day. During this period, it is advisable to keep silence, mouna, and avoid physical or mental work. Rest the following day also.  Second  Climate: Shankhaprakshalana should not be performed when the weather conditions are extrerne. Those who live in cold climates should practise in the summer when the days are warm and dry. This is important, as it is easy for the stomach and intestines to become chilled. On the other hand, do not practise when it is very hot as this would produce too much sweat and the experience would be exhausting.  Very cloudy, windy or rainy weather is also to be avoided. The best time to practise is at the changeover of seasons.   Frequency: This practice should not be performed more than twice a year.  Frequency: Once a week is sufficient for general purposes. In cases of constipation, however, it may be practised daily until the condition improves.  Frequency: Once a week is sufficient for general purposes. In cases of constipation, however, it may be practised daily until the condition improves.   restrictions: For at least one month after the practice, all chemically processed, synthetic, pungent, spicy, acidic, rich and non-vegetarian foods must be strictly avoided.  499 No pickles, sweets, chocolates, ice cream or soft drinks should be taken. Milk, buttermilk, yoghurt and all fruits, especially acidic fruits such as lemons, grapefruit, oranges or pineapples are restricted. Alcohol, cigarettes, tea, coffee, betel nut preparations such as paan and any type of intoxicant or drug should not be taken.  The diet should be as pure, simple and neutral as possible. It may include foods such as rice, wheat, bread, vegetables with a low acidic content, nuts, lentils and other pulses. Common sense must be used in this regard. After shankhaprakshalana the digestive system is very vulnerable and extra care should be taken to protect it.   Warning: This practice should only be attempted in an ashram  or yoga centre under the guidance of a competent teacher. All guidelines and restrictions must be followed strictly to avoid experiencing harmful side-effects. Those who are unable to follow these restrictions should not practise shankhaprakshalana. They will find the simplified version, laghoo shankhaprakshalana, more appropriate to their needs. Strong medication such as antibiotics should be avoided for one month.

It strengthens the immune system, reduces excessive mucus and purifies the blood. Shankhaprakshalana recharges the entire pranic body, removes blockages from the nadis and purifies all the chakras. The harmony of the five pranas is restored and the energy level is raised.  500 Mentally, it calms the mind and prepares the way for higher states of consciousness. Any sadhana performed after this cleansing practice gives manifold results. Practice Benefits: The laghoo or short method is intended to encourage normal functioning of the intestines. It is an excellent method of encouraging good bowel movement and is ideal for regular use and for those who are unable to practise  502 the full version. Laghoo is recommended for digestive disorders and to flush out the kidneys.  Practice Benefits: This practice helps to prevent constipation and related digestive problems. It makes the body feel light and ensures a healthy intake of water first thing in the morning.  503  ","Contra-indications: Those people who suffer from chronic bleeding in the nose should not do sutra neti. Anyone with nasal ulcers, polyps, or severe malformations of the nasal septum or turbinates should first seek the advice of a yogic or ayurvedic doctor.

It strength- ens the back, and especially the thigh muscles. It induces a state of relaxation and equanimity.  194 Backward Bending Asanas  Backward bending asanas are postures which turn the body out to face the world. They are stimulating and extroverting. Because they expand the chest and encourage inhalation, they are associated with the attitude of embracing life. They are also dynamic postures which move counter to gravity and, there- fore, require strength and energy to perform.  On a physical level, the backward bending asanas stretch the abdominal muscles, and tone and strengthen the muscles controlling the spine. The spinal nerves, which emerge from between the adjoining vertebrae, are decompressed. This has beneficial repercussions throughout the body since these nerves give energy to all the other nerves, organs and muscles in the body.  The spinal column is a ‘stacked pile’ of vertebrae and discs. Groups of muscles extend all along it, covering and support- ing it from all sides. Maintenance of the spine in a straight and aligned position, despite all movement, depends totally on the balanced, supportive contraction and tone of the mus- cles. The muscles themselves are controlled unconsciously through posture.  Subconscious tensions and ‘hang-ups’ are often reflected in the tonic activity of the back muscles, resulting in too hard or too lax zones instead of homogeneous consistency. Research has shown that 90% of backache has its origin in muscular imbalance. If these imbalances are prolonged, then the ‘stack pile’ of the vertebral column is disaligned, the ligaments are strained and symptoms of spondylitis, slipped disc, sciatica and osteoarthritis begin to manifest.  195 The practice ofa balanced regime of backward and forward bending asanas can correct postural defects and neuro-muscu- lar imbalances of the vertebral column. As with all asanas, it is important to perform these practices with proper control and synchronization of the breath so that the whole group of mus- cles is uniformly contracted.  Impure blood has a tendency to accumulate in the back region where circulation tends to be sluggish due to continu- ous maintenance of an upright position. These asanas help to circulate, purify and enrich the blood in this region. Backward bending asanas create a negative pressure in the abdomen and pelvis, helping neuro-circulatory toning of all the related or- gans. They also massage the abdomen and pelvic organs by stretching the muscles in this area, especially the rectus abdomini.  People with excessive lower back curve (lumbar lordosis) should not practise the asanas in this section, apart from saral bhujangasana, ardha shalabasana and gomukhasana. Gener- ally, during pregnancy, asanas where the stomach is weight- bearing are not recommended. Of the asanas in this section, kandharasana practised gently will give the benefits of back- ward bends. In general, the specific contra-indications for each practice should also be carefully observed.  Right-handed people will find theseasanas are easily learned with the right side leading. They should then be practised with the left side leading to counterbalance the effect of habitual behaviour patterns.  196  ",,,,,,,

The practi- tioner should always avoid undue strain. The ability to keep the eyes open without blinking should be developed gradually with consistent practice. Trataka is an excellent method for clearing accumulated complexes, problems and suppressed thoughts from the mind, enabling the practitioner to witness what is surfacing. It is also possible, however, for these problems to manifest toorapidly, which may be mentally disturbing. If this occurs, stop the practice and seek advice from a competent teacher. Trataka focuses the mind and curbs oscillating tendencies, making it one-pointed and awakening inner vision. All the attention and power of the mind is channelled into one continuous stream. Once this has been achieved, the latent potential within the mind is able to arise spontaneously.  Alternative           practice: Trataka may be performed at any time, but the best time is at dawn or dusk when the stomach is empty.        Precautions: In the case of eye ailments, such as eyestrain, astigmatism and even the early symptoms of cataract, see the alternative practices on the following page. People with myopia (short-sightedness) severe enough to warrant glasses should retain their glasses while practising trataka on a flame.   Sequence: Trataka should be performed after asanas, prana- yamas, mudras and bandhas to steady the body and mind.   Duration: Beginners should gaze for 1 or 2 minutes only, and then close the eyes. For general purposes 5 to 10 minutes is sufficient. For spiritual purposes, trataka may be per- formed for extended periods of time under the guidance of a competent teacher. Those who suffer from insomnia and mental tension should perform this practice for 10 to 15 minutes before sleeping at night.                          mantras: ham, representing the sun or solar force, and tham, representing the moon or lunar force. To bring about a balance between these two forces, the body must first be purified by the shatkarmas, asanas, pranayamas, mudras and bandhas. The aim of hatha yoga is to balance these two flows.  When ida and pingala nadis are purified and balanced, and the mind is controlled, then sushumna, the most important nadi, begins to flow. Sushumna must be flowing for success in meditation. If pingala flows, the body will be restless; if ida flows, the mind will be overactive. When sushumna flows, kundalini awakens and rises through the chakras.  535 Nadis and the nervous system  At the physical level, ida and pingala correspond to the two aspects of the autonomic nervous system. Pingala coincides with the sympathetic nervous system and ida with the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the stimulation and acceleration of activities concerned with the external environment and the deceleration of the organs which tend to utilize a lot of energy internally. The sympathetic nerves speed up the heart, dilate the blood vessels, increase the respiration rate and intensify the efficiency of the eyes, ears and other sense organs. The parasympathetic nerves directly oppose the sympathetic nerves because they reduce the heartbeat, constrict the blood vessels and slow the respiration. This results in introversion. The flow of prana in ida and pingala is completely involuntary and unconscious until controlled by yogic practices.  Sensitivity and awareness  The primary requirements for locating the chakras and nadis and visualizing their symbols and pathways on the psychic plane are sensitivity and awareness. The practices presented in this text all relate to specific chakras and nadis. The actual purpose of these practices is to purify and balance the chakras and nadis so that the kundalini can awaken and uplift human consciousness. As the chakras and nadis become regulated, the awareness of these subtle dimensions is automatically stimulated and the spiritual vision opens. This has been the experience of yogis from time immemorial. In order to attain this experience for oneself, regularity in practice is essential.  536 Index of Practices     A Abdominal (or diaphragmatic) breathing ...............00 379 Abdominal rotation or ChuUrming ..........secsessesereseeseseeees 517 Advasana (reversed COrpSe POSE) .......sssssessseseeesereseeesersseees 88 Agnisara Kriya (activating the digestive fire) ...

Practise in daylight or with steady background lighting.  Epileptics should not practise trataka on a candle flame, but should choose a black dot or some other completely steady object to gaze at, with steady background light.  Note. The word trataka means ‘to look’ or ‘to gaze’. Trataka is the last of the shatkarmas. It acts as a stepping-stone between physically oriented practices and mental practices which lead to higher states of awareness. It forms a bridge between hatha yoga and raja yoga. Traditionally, it is a part of hatha yoga, but it may also be considered a part of raja yoga.  525 Psychic Physiology of Yoga  In this book, together with each practice, a particular point is recommended for concentration. If the aim is to relax and gain optimum physical benefit from yoga practices, it is necessary to concentrate on something. By directing the mind to a specific region of the body or to the breath, the effect of a particular practice is increased. Sometimes one of the chakras or psychic centres is also used as a point for spiritual concentration.  On a physical level, chakras are associated with the major nerve plexuses and endocrine glands in the body. Many asanas have a particularly powerful and beneficial effect on one or more of these glands or plexuses. For example, sarvangasana exerts a strong pressure on the thyroid gland in the throat region, which is associated with vishuddhi chakra. The thyroid is given a good massage and its functioning is greatly improved. However, if the concentration is directed to this chakra while performing the asana, the beneficial effects will be increased.  Definition of chakra  The word chakra literally means ‘wheel’ or ‘circle’, but in the yogic context a better translation is ‘vortex’ or ‘whirlpool’. The chakras are vortices of pranic energy at specific areas in the body which control the circulation of prana permeating the entire human structure. Each chakra is a switch which turns on or opens up patterns of behaviour, thought or emotional reactions which may have been unconscious in our everyday life. They relate to specific areas of the brain, and in most people these psychic centres lie dormant and inactive.  526 Concentration on the chakras while performing yogic practices stiniulates the flow of energy through the chakras and helps to activate them. This in turn awakens the dormant areas in the brain and the corresponding faculties in the psychic and mental bodies, allowing one to experience planes of consciousness which are normally inaccessible.  The major chakras are seven in number and are located along the pathway of sushwnna, an energy channel which flows through the centre of the spinal cord. Sushumna originates at the perineum and terminates at the top of the head. The chakras are connected to a network of psychic channels called nadis, which correspond to the nerves, but are more subtle in nature. The chakras are depicted symbolically as lotus flowers, each having a particular number of petals and a characteristic colour. The lotus symbolizes the three stages the aspirant must pass through in spiritual                                life: ignorance, aspiration and illumination. It represents spiritual growth from the lowest state ofawareness to the highest state of consciousness.  The petals of the lotus, inscribed with the dja mantras or seed sounds of the Sanskrit alphabet, represent the different manifestations of psychic energy connected with the chakras, and the nadis or psychic channels leading into and out of them. Within each chakra is a yantra, comprised of the geometrical symbol of its associated element andits bija mantra. Within the yantra there is also a presiding deity, which represents particular aspects of consciousness, along with the corresponding vahana or vehicle which is an animal form, representing the centre's other psychic aspects.  Description of the seven chakras  Mooladhara  chakra: The lowest of the chakras is situated at the perineum in the male body and at the cervix in the female body. The word mool means ‘root’ and adhara means ‘place’. Therefore, it is known as the root centre. Mooladhara chakra is associated with the sense of smell and the anus. It is symbolized by a deep red lotus with four petals. In the centre is a yellow square, the yantra of prithvi tattwa, the earth element, and the  527 Sahasrara  Bindu  Ajna  Vishuddhi  Anahata  Manipura  Swadhisthana     Mooladhara              Location of the Chakras  bija mantra /am. In the centre of the square is a red triangle, the symbol of shakti or creative energy, with its apex pointing downward. Within the triangle is the smoky coloured swayambhu linga, symbolizing the astral body. A red serpent, representing the dormant kundalini, is coiled three and a half times around the linga. The red triangle is supported by an elephant with seven trunks, which symbolizes the stability and solidarity of the earth.  528 Mooladhara chakra is the seat or dwelling place of primal energy, kundalint shakti. Kundalini is the serpent coiled in deep slumber around swayambhu linga. It is the source of all energy in humankind and the universe, whether sexual, emotional, mental, psychic or spiritual. While this energy is one, it takes on various qualities and attributes, depending on the psychic centre through which it manifests. The aim of yoga is to awaken the dormant kundalini through self-purification and con- centration of mind and to lead it up through the chakras to sahasrara where, as pure energy or Shakti, it unites with pure consciousness, Shiva.  For concentration on mooladhara chakra, visualize the red inverted triangle or the yellow square, symbols of energy and solidity, to enhance inner stability and balance.  Swadhisthana chakra: Approximately two fingers’ width above mooladhara chakra, in the spine, is the concentration point for swadhisthana chakra. The literal meaning of the word swadhisthana is ‘one’s own abode’. The Sanskrit word swa means ‘self and sthan means ‘dwelling place’. This chakra is symbolized by a crimson lotus with six petals. In the centre is a white crescent moon, the yantra of apes tattwa, the water element, and the bija mantra vam. The crescent moon yantra and the bija mantra are riding on a crocodile, symbolizing the underlying movement of the karmas.  Swadhisthana chakra is associated with seeking pleasure and security. It is associated with the tongue and genital organs. In swadhisthana the emphasis is on overcoming fear, and on enjoyment, on pleasurable sensations and sexual interaction. When swadhisthana becomes active, it may manifest as overwhelming desires or cravings.  Ona deeper level, swadhisthana is the seat of the individual and collective unconscious; it is the storehouse of all samskaras, past mental impressions stored in the form of archetypes. It is the centre of humankind’s most primitive and deep-rooted instincts. By purifying this centre, the animal nature is transcended. For concentration on this centre, visualize a vast, deep ocean with dark waves beneath a night sky. The tides of the ocean represent the ebb and flow of awareness.  529 Manipura chakra: Situated in the spine behind the navel is manipura chakra. The word mani means ‘gem’ and pura means ‘city’. Therefore, manipura means ‘city of jewels’. It is so called because, being the fire centre, it is lustrous like a jewel and radiant with vitality and energy. This chakra is depicted as a bright yellow lotus with ten petals. Within the lotus is a fiery red triangle, the yantra of agni tattwa, the fire element, and the bija mantra ram. The animal which serves as the vehicle for manipura is the ram, the symbol of assertiveness and energy.  Manipura is the centre of self-assertion, dynamism and dominance. It is associated with vision and the feet, with ambition and the will and ability to rule. On the negative side, this may be expressed in despotism and in seeing things and people merely as a means to gain personal power or to satisfy personal needs.  The solar plexus is the centre chiefly concerned with the vital process of digestion and food metabolism. It governs the functioning of the gastric glands, the pancreas, gall bladder and so on, which produce and secrete enzymes, acids and juices necessary for the digestion and absorption of nutrients. Manipura chakra is the psychic centre which controls these activities and the instinctive drive to find food and nurture oneself.  The adrenal glands located above the kidneys are also related with manipura. They secrete adrenaline into the blood during an emergency situation. This has the effect of speeding up all the physiological processes, making the mind sharp and alert, the heart beat faster, the respiration rate more rapid and so on. The body is then prepared for a more intense level of activity than normal in what is commonly called the ‘fight or flight’ reaction. Those people who suffer from sluggishness and depression or malfunctions of the digestive system, such as diabetes and indigestion, should concentrate on manipura chakra and try to feel energy radiating from this region.  For concentration on this centre, visualize the blazing sun or a ball of fire. Experience energy in the form of light radiating from this region and permeating the whole body.  530 Anahata chakra: Situated in the spine, behind the sternum, level with the heart, is anahata chakra. The word anahata literally means ‘unstruck’. All sound in the manifested universe is produced by the striking together of two objects, which sets up vibrations or sound waves. However, the primordial sound, which issues from beyond this material world, is the source of all sound and is known as anahad nada, the unstruck sound. The heart centre is where this sound manifests. It may be perceived by the yogi as an internal, unborn and undying vibration, the pulse of the universe.  This chakra is symbolized by a blue lotus with twelve petals. In the centre of the lotusis a hexagon, formed by two interlacing triangles. This is the yantra of vayu tattwa, the air element. The bija mantra is yam and the vehicle is a swift black antelope. the symbol of alertness. Anahata chakra is the centre associated with the sense of touch (feeling), the hands (giving and taking), and emotions, ranging from the narrow attachments of jealousy to unconditional love. As this level is purified, the feelings of universal fellowship and tolerance begin to develop and all beings are accepted and loved for what they are.  On the physical level, anahata is associated with the heart and lungs, and the circulatory and respiratory systems. For meditation on anahata chakra, visualize a blue lotus or a blue hexagon, formed by two interlacing triangles, with a tiny, bright flame burning at the centre. Imagine it to be steady and unflickering like a flame in a windless place. This is the symbol of the jivatma, the individual soul, the indwelling spirit of all beings which is undisturbed by the winds of the world.  Vishuddhi chakra: Situated at the back of the neck, behind the throat pit, is vishuddhi chakra, the centre of purification. The word shuddhi means ‘purification’ and the prefix vi enhances this quality. It is symbolized by a violet lotus with sixteen petals. In the centre of the lotus is a white circle, the yantra of akasha tattwa, the ether element, and the beeja mantra is ham. The animal related to vishuddhi chakra is a white elephant. Right understanding and discrimination develop at vishuddhi chakra. Here the dualities of life are accepted, allowing one to flow with life and let things happen as they will.  531 Vishuddhi chakra governs the ears and the vocal cords, the region of the larynx, and the thyroid and parathyroid glands. It is the centre related with communication. The throat centre is the place where the divine nectar called amrita, the mystical elixir of immortality, is tasted. This nectar is a kind of sweet secretion which is produced at bindu chakra and then falls down tovishuddhiwhere it is purifiedand processed for further use throughout the body.  For concentration on this centre, visualize a large white drop ofnectar. Try to experienceicy cold drops of sweet nectar falling down to vishuddhi, giving a feeling of blissful intoxication.  Ajna chakra: Situated in the midbrain, behind the eyebrow centre, at the top of the spine, is ajna chakra. This centre is also known by various names such  as: the third eye; jnana chakshu, the eye of wisdom; ¢riveni, the confluence of three rivers; guru chakra and the eye of Shiva. The word ajna means ‘command’. In deeper states of meditation the disciple receives commands and guidance from the guru, and from the divine or higher self, through this chakra.  Ajna chakra is depicted as a silver lotus with two petals, which represent the sun and the moon, or pingala, the positive force, and ida, the negative force. These two pranic flows, which are responsible for the experience of duality, converge at this centre with sushumna, the spiritual force. In the centre of the lotus is the sacred bija mantra Aum. The element of this chakra is the mind. This is the centre where wisdom and intuition develop. When ajna is awakened, the mind becomes steady and strong, and full control over prana is gained.  Ajna corresponds to the pineal gland, which has almost atrophied in the adult human being. On the psychic plane, this point is the bridge between the mental and psychic dimensions. Therefore, ajna chakra is responsible for supramental faculties such as clairvoyance, clairaudience and telepathy.  Thought is also a very subtle form of energy. When ajna chakra is awakened, it is possible to send and receive thought transmission through this centre. It is like a psychic doorway opening into deeper and higher realms of awareness.  532 Stimulating ajna chakra develops all the faculties of the mind, such as intelligence, memory and concentration.  For concentration on ajna chakra, the point of bkrumadhya at the eyebrow centre is used. Visualize a tiny point of light or an Aum symbol at this centre and let the thoughts dwell on the inner guru.   Bindu: At the top of the back of the head, where Hindu brahmins grow a small tuft of hair, is a point known as bindu. The word bindu means ‘point’ or ‘drop’. Bindu is symbolized by a tiny crescent moon on a dark night. Bindu is the centre of nada, psychic sound. This centre is used for concentration on the psychic sounds that may manifest there in practices such as bhramari pranayama and shanmukhi mudra, which are used to develop the awareness of nada.   Sahasrara: Situated at the crown of the head is sahasrara. It is the abode of highest consciousness. The word sahasrara means ‘one thousand’. Sahasrara is visualized as a shining lotus of a thousand petals, containing the fifty letters of the Sanskrit alphabet twenty times over. In the centre of the lotus is a shining jyotirlinga, lingam of light, symbol of pure conscious- ness. In sahasrara the mystical union of Shiva and Shakti takes place, the fusion of consciousness with matter and energy, the individual soul with the supreme soul. When kundalini awakens, it ascends through the chakras to sahasrara and merges into the source fromwhence it originated. Matter and energy merge into pure consciousness in a state of intoxicating bliss. Having  attained this, the yogi gains supreme knowledge and passes beyond birth and death.  Nadis  The word. nadi literally means ‘flow’ or ‘current’. The ancient texts say that there are seventy-two thousand nadis in the psychic body. These are visible as currents of light to a person who has developed psychic vision. In recent times the word nadi has been translated as ‘nerve’, but actually nadis are blueprints for physical manifestation. Like the chakras, they are not actually part of the physical body, although they corre- spond with the nerves. Nadis are the subtle channels through  533 which the pranic forces flow. Out of the large number of nadis in the psychic body, ten are major. Of these, three are most signifi-  cant: ida, pingala and sushum- na. The most important of these three is sushumna. All the nadis in the psychic body are subordi- nate to sushumna.  Ida, pingala and sushumna  Sushumna nadi is the spiritual channel, and to concentrate on it, awareness is taken to the centre of the spinal cord. Sushumna originates from mooladhara chakraand termin- ates at sahasrara. Ida nadi flows from the left side of mooladhara in spirals, passing through each chakra in turn, forming a criss- cross pathway which terminates at the left side of ajna chakra. Pingala nadi flows from the right side of mooladhara, mirroring ida, terminatingat the right side Mooladhara  of ajna. Ida and pingala repre-  sent the two opposites forces  flowing within us. Ida is passive, introvert and feminine; it is also known as the chandra or moon nadi. Pingala, on the other hand, is active, extrovert and masculine, and is called the surya or sun nadi.  Pingala        Pranic currents and the breath  These pranic currents, ida, pingala and sushumna, operate alternately. The current that is flowing at any particular time may be gauged by noting the flow of the breath in the nostrils. When the left nostril has a greater flow of air, then ida nadi is  534 predominant. When the flow is greater in the right nostril, then pingala is predominant. If the flow is equal, then sushumna is predominant. When the right nostril (pingala) flows, there is more vital energy for physical work, digestion of food and so on. The mind is extroverted and the body generates more heat. When the left nostril (ida) is flowing, mental energy is dominant. The mind is introverted and any kind of mental work may be undertaken. During sleep, ida nadi flows predominantly. If pingala flows at night, sleep will be restlessness and disturbed. Likewise, if ida flows while taking food, the digestive process may be slow, causing indigestion.  Altering the flow of nadis and breath  All activities are influenced by the flow of these nadis, which alternate approximately every sixty to ninety minutes. It is possible to alter the flow voluntarily by using yogic techniques such as asana and pranayama. For example, if ida nadi is flowing and there is physical work to be done, it is possible to redirect the flow of the breath to pingala nadi to obtain the necessary energy.

204,TRIKONASANA," note: In all variations except 4, it is important not to bend forward, otherwise the benefits of the sideways stretch to the trunk will be lost. To avoid bending forward, pay particular attention to the position of the hips when bending to the side. For example, when bending to the right side, ensure that the left hip stays back and does not move forward.  Increasing the distance between the feet gives a more powerful stretch to the rarely used inner thigh muscles and the top of the thighs.     |: Stand erect with the feet more than shoulder width apart. Turn the right foot to the right side. Stretch the arms sideways and raise them to shoulder level so that they are in one straight line. Bendtotheright, taking care not tobring the body forward. Simultaneously bend the right knee slightly. Place the right hand on the right foot, keeping the two arms in line with each other. Turn the left palm forward. Look up at the left hand in the final position. Return to the upright position with the arms in a straight line. Repeat on the other side, bending the left knee slightly. This completes one round. Practise 5 to 10 rounds.    2: Repeat the basic form, but instead of keeping the upper arm vertical in the final position, lower it over the ear until it is parallel to the floor with the palm facing down. Try not to bend forward, but to keep the body in one vertical plane. Look up at the hand.  Slowly return to the starting position. Practise 5 to 10 rounds.  Advanced    3: Stand with the feet more than shoulder width apart and the toes facing forward. Gaze directly in front. Place the palms of the hands on each side of the waist with the fingers pointing downward.  Slowly bend to the right from the hips while sliding the right hand down along the outside of the right thigh as far as is comfortable.  Do not strain and do not bend forward in an effort to achieve the final position in which the right hand reaches the foot. Flexibility will come with practice.  Stay in the final position for a few seconds.  156 Raise the trunk to the upright position, returning the right hand to the waist. Repeat on the left side to complete one round. Practise 10 rounds.   4: Stand erect with the feet more than shoulder width apart and raise the arms sideways to shoulder level. This is the starting position.  Bend forward.  Twist the trunk to the right, bringing the left hand to the right foot.  The right arm should be stretched vertically so that both arms form a straight line.  Look up at the right hand.  157 Hold the final position for a few seconds, feeling the twist  and stretch of the back.  Return to the centre forward position.  Raise the body to the starting position, keeping the arms  outstretched to the sides.  Repeat to the other side.  This is one round.  Do not lower the arms. Practise 5 tol0 rounds.   practice: When variations 1 and 2canbe performed  easily, they can be done keeping both legs straight.        BsY ©  Variation practice: Repeat the procedure as described, but place the right palm flat on the floor on the outside of the left foot. On twisting to the right, the left palm should be placed on the floor outside the right foot. This variation gives a far greater stretch to the leg and back muscles.  Dynamic practice: Perform the posture rapidly without re- turning to the vertical starting position between both halves of the round. The breath is relaxed. If there is no strain, it can be practised for an increased number of rounds.         Sequence: Each variation should be practised separately to increase flexibility and strength. When each can be practised without strain, they can be combined. This series may be performed daily for a few weeks to tone the entire body.  General                                                                                   benefits: This series affects the muscles on the sides of the trunk, the waist and the back of the legs. It stimulates the nervous system and alleviates nervous depression. It improves digestion. It also strengthens the pelvic area and tones the reproductive organs. Regular practice will help to reduce waistline fat.  158 Practice                   ","Awareness: On the stretch along the side of the trunk, legs and arms, on keeping the balance, and on coordinating the movement with the breath.

205,UDARAKARSHANASANA," note: The benefits are enhanced if the exercise is practised in front of the rising or setting sun. Be aware of the warmth and light on the closed lids. Never look directly at the sun, except for a few initial moments when it is just rising or when it is about to set.  77 Exercise note: If the arms become tired they should be sup- ported on two stools.  79    FRONT AND SIDEWAYS VIEWING     Exercise note: Lie in shavasana for a few minutes after com- pleting all 8 exercises.  84 Relaxation Asanas  The importance of this series of relaxation poses cannot be over-emphasized. They should be performed before and after the asana session and at any time when the body becomes tired. The asanas in this group appear very easy at first, yet to do them properly is quite difficult as the tension in all the muscles of the body must be consciously released. The muscles often seem to be completely relaxed but, in fact, tightness still remains. Even during sleep, relaxation is elusive.  The asanas in this chapter give the body the rest it so badly needs. Constant postural abnormalities put excess strain on the muscles of the back and just lying down does not relieve it. These relaxation practices, which are done in the prone position, are very relaxing to the spine and related structures. They are especially recommended for any back/spinal problem. These postures can be adopted during any time of the day for any comfortable duration. They can be combined with relaxing daily activities as well.  85    |: Palming Sit quietly and close the eyes.  Rub the palms of the hands together vigorously until they become warm. Place the palms gently over the eyelids, without any undue pressure.  Feel the warmth and energy being transmitted from the hands into the eyes and the eye muscles relaxing.  The eyes are being bathed in a soothing darkness. Remain in this position until the heat from the hands has been absorbed by the eyes.  Then lower the hands, keeping the eyes closed.  Again rub the palms together until they become hot and place them over the closed eyes. (Make sure the palms and not the fingers cover the eyes.)  Repeat this procedure at least 3 times.    2: Blinking  Sit with the eyes open.  Blink the eyes 10 times quickly.  Close the eyes and relax for 5 or 6 relaxed breaths. Repeat the blinking 10 times quickly and then again close the eyes and relax.  Repeat 5 times.     3: Sideways viewing Assume a sitting position with the legs straight in front of the body. Raise the arms to the sides at shoulder level, keeping them straight, make a loose fist and point the thumbs upwards. The thumbs should be just in the peripheral vision when  78 the head is facing forward. If they are not clearly visible, bring them slightly forward until they come into view. The head should not move. Look at a fixed point directly in front and on a level with the eyes. Fix the position of the head in this neutral position. Then, without moving the head sideways, focus the eyes on the following, one after the  4: Front and sideways viewing Maintain the same body position as in exercise 3, but place the left fist on the left knee so that the thumb points upward. Hold the right thumb to the right of the body so that it points upward. Without moving the head, focus the eyes on the left thumb, then on the right thumb and then return to the left thumb. Repeat this process 10 times, then rest and close the eyes. Repeat the same procedure on the left side of the body. _Keep the head and spine straight throughout. Finally, close and rest the eyes. Palming may be performed several times.  5: Up and down viewing Maintain the same position as in exercise 4. Place both fists on the knees with both thumbs pointing upward. Keeping the arms straight, slowly raise the left thumb while following the motion of the thumb with the eyes. Once the thumb is raised to the maximum, slowly return to the starting position, all the time keeping the eyes focused on the thumb without moving the head. Practise the same movement with the right thumb. Repeat 10 times with each thumb. Keep the head and spine straight throughout. Finally, close and rest the eyes. Palming may be performed several times. .        6: Rotational viewing Maintain the same body position as in exercise 5. Place the right hand on the right knee. Hold the left fist above the left leg with the left thumb pointing upward and the elbow straight. Make a large circular movement with the left arm to the left, then upward, curving to the right, and finally returning to the starting position. Keep the eyes focused on the thumb without moving the head. Perform 10 times clockwise and then 10 times anti- clockwise. Repeat with the right thumb. Keep the head and spine straight throughout. Finally, close and rest the eyes. Palming may be performed several times.      Note: Tius is one of the asanas practised in shankhaprakshalana. Take care not to overstretch the back as the body begins to feel lighter and more flexible.  73 Yoga Exercises for the Eyes  Many people wear spectacles or contact lenses to improve their vision. Glasses, however, do not actually cure bad eye- sight. In fact, eye problems frequently get worse through their use, necessitating ever more powerful lenses.  Factors which contribute to bad eyesight    7: Preliminary Nasikagra Drishti (preliminary nosetip gazing) Sit with the legs straight in front or in a cross-legged pose. Hold the left arm straight directly in front of the nose. Make a fist with the left hand, keeping the thumb pointing upward. Focus both eyes on the tip of the thumb. Bend the arm and slowly bring the thumb to the nosetip, keeping the eyes focused on the tip of the thumb. Remain for a few seconds with the thumb held at the nosetip and the eyes focused there. Slowly straighten the arm, continuing to gaze at the thumb tip. This is one round. Practise 10 rounds. Keep the head and spine straight throughout. Finally, close and rest the eyes. Palming may be performed several times.   8: Near and distant viewing Stand or sit at an open window, preferably with a clear view of the horizon, with the arms by the sides. Focus the eyes on the nosetip, nasikagra drishti, for 5 seconds. Then focus on a distant object on the horizon for 5 seconds. Repeat this process 10 times. Close the eyes and relax. Palming may be performed at this time.   9: Udarakarshanasana (abdominal stretch pose) Squat with the feet apart and the hands on the knees. Inhale deeply.  Exhale, bringing the right knee to the floor near the left  foot.  Using the left hand as a lever, push the left knee towards  the right, simultaneously twisting to the left. Keep the inside of the right foot on the floor.  Try to squeeze the lower abdomen with the combined  pressure of both thighs. Look over the left shoulder.  Hold the breath out for 3 to 5 seconds in the final position.  Inhale when returning to the starting position.  Repeat on the other side of the body to complete one  round. Practise 5 to 10 rounds.                         Preparation: Before starting, it is a good idea to splash pure, cold water onto the eyes a few times. Hold a little water in the palms above a water basin and splash it onto the eyelids. Do this about 10 times and then begin the exercises. This procedure will help stimulate the blood supply and generally tone up the eyes.             are: artificial and bad lighting, prolonged computer use, television or videowatch- ing, poor diet, muscle inefficiency due to prolonged hours of office work and study, mental and emotional tension, toxic condition of the body and ageing.  Solving the problem of lighting is fairly straightforward. Diet, however, is more complex and it affects not only the health of the eyes, but of the whole body. Simplifying the diet and avoiding heavy, indigestible, oily, spicy foods as well as tinned, processed, pre-packed and junk foods will help rectify poor vision. A vegetarian diet is also recommended or, at least, a reduction in non-vegetarian food.  Contrary to popular belief, long periods of reading do not damage the eyes, providing the mind and eyes are relaxed while doing so. If there is tension, then even a short period of reading can strain the eyes. Try to develop the ability to read with relaxed awareness and a good posture. Before starting to read, if mental or muscular tension is experienced in the eyes, perform shashankasana for a few minutes. This asana will do much to calm the mind and relax the eyes.  Try to depend less on the use of glasses. Use them only when it is absolutely necessary. Leave them off during leisure time whenever possible. This will help the eyes to adjust and start functioning normally.  74 The habit of walking with bare feet on the grass, sand or bare earth, either early in the morning or around sunset, is claimed to have a relaxing and beneficial effect on the eyes. This is due to the reflex connections between the soles of the feet and the visual areas of the brain. It is especially recom- mended where the feet are often in restrictive footwear.  A simple sun bath may also be taken while facing the rising or setting sun. The eyes should be closed. Feel the ultra-violet rays soothing and relaxing the eyes.  Eye                                           exercises: Excluding diseases such as glaucoma, trachoma and cataract, the most common eye disorders today are related to functional defects in the ocular muscles exacerbated by chronic mental and emotional tension. The following simple exercises help to alleviate various disorders related to the malfunctioning of the eye muscles, such as short and long-sightedness, presbyopia and squint.  The eye exercises shouldbe practised regularly with patience and perseverance. Do not expect instant cure or improvement. It takes years for the eyes to become defective; it will also take time, a few months or more, before noticeable progress will be made. However, improvement will come, as it has to many people who have adopted a yogic way of life and gradually reduced the power of their glasses.   notes: Eye exercises should be performed one af- ter the other in the sequence given. The series should be  75 practised in its entirety, once early in the morning and/or once in the evening.  The most important thing to remember during practice is to be totally relaxed. Do not strain as this will lead to fatigue and tiredness of the eyes. The facial muscles, eyebrows and eyelids should remain totally relaxed. After each exercise the eyes should be closed and rested for at least halfa minute. The practice of palming may be performed at this time.  Glasses should not be worn while performing the eye exercises.  76 PALMING  BSYD  Exercise  other: a) left thumb b) space between the eyebrows, bhrumadhya c) right thumb d) space between the eyebrows e) left thumb. Repeat this cycle 10 times, keeping the head and spine straight throughout. Finally, close and rest the eyes. Palming may be performed several times.                 ","Awareness: On the movement and the alternate stretch and compression of the lower abdomen, and on the syn-  chronized breath.  ",Breathing: Inhale in the neutral position. Exhale while looking to the sides. Inhale and come to the centre.  Breathing: Inhale in the neutral position. Exhale while looking forward. Inhale while looking to the side. Breathing: Inhale while raising the eyes. Exhale while lowering the eyes.  Breathing: Inhale while completing the upperarc of the circle. Exhale while completing the lower arc. The breath should be smooth and synchronized with the forming of a perfect circle.  Breathing: Inhale as the thumb is drawn towards the nose. Exhale as the arm is straightened.  Breathing: Inhale during near viewing. Exhale during distant viewing.  ,"Benefits: This pose is very useful for abdominal ailments because it alternately compresses and stretches the organs and muscles of this region. It also relieves constipation.  Benefits: Palming relaxes and revitalizes the eye muscles, and stimulates the circulation of the aqueous humour, the liquid that runs between the cornea and the lens of the eye, aiding the correction of defective vision.  Practice Benefits: Many people with defective eyesight blink irregularly and unnaturally. This is related to the state of habitual tension in the eyes. This exercise encourages the blinking reflex to become spontaneous, inducing relaxation of the eye muscles.  SIDEWAYS VIEWING     Exercise Benefits: Sideways viewing relaxes the tension of the muscles strained by constant reading and close work. It also prevents and corrects squint.  Practice Benefits: Front and sideways viewing improves coordination of the medial and lateral muscles of the eyeball.  80    UP AND DOWN VIEWING           Exercise Benefits: Up and down viewing balances the upper and lower eyeball muscles.  81 ROTATIONAL VIEWING     Exercise Benefits: Rotational viewing improves the coordinated acti- vities of all the eye muscles.  82    PRELIMINARY NASIKAGRA DRISHTI       BST @  Exercise Benefits: This exercise improves the accommodating and focusing power of the eye muscles.  83 Exercise Benefits: Same as for Exercise 7, but the range of movements in these eye muscles is further increased.  Practice ","Contra-indications: Not for people with knee problems or  sciatica.  72 Contra-indications: Those who suffer from major eye dis- eases or disorders such as glaucoma, trachoma, cataract, retinal detachment, retinal artery or vein thrombosis, iritis, keratitis or conjunctivitis should only perform yoga practices after consulting an eye specialist. Inverted asanas and kunjal kriya should be avoided altogether while the condition lasts. Adopt- ing a yogic lifestyle and a simple vegetarian diet, however, may be of great benefit.  Practice ",,,,,,
206,UDDIYANA BANDHA," note: Uddiyana bandha must be practised on an empty stomach. The bowels should alsobe empty. Agnisara kriya is an excellent preparatory practice.  Note. The Sanskrit word uddiyana means ‘to rise up’ or ‘to fly upward’. This practice is so called because the physical lock applied to the body causes the diaphragm to rise towards the chest. Uddiyana is therefore often translated as the stomach lift. Another meaning is that the physical lock helps to direct prana into sushumna nadi so that it flows upward to sahasrara chakra.  482            practice: Standing abdominal contraction Stand erect with the feet about half a metre apart. Inhale deeply through the nostrils. Bend forward from the waist and exhale all the air through the mouth. Empty the lungs as much as possible. Hold the breath outside. Keep the spine horizontal and bend the knees slightly. Place the palms of the hands on the thighs just above the knees, so that the knees are supporting the weight of the upper body. The fingers can point either downward or inwards. Make sure the arms are straight. In this position there is an automatic contraction of the abdominal region. Bend the head forward, but do not press the chin against the chest. Make a false inhalation, keeping the glottis closed and expanding the chest, as though breathing in but not actually taking in air.  479 Straighten the knees.  This movement will automatically draw the abdomen upward and inward towards the spine to form uddiyana bandha.  Hold this position for a comfortable length of time.  Do not strain.  Release the abdominal lock and relax the chest.  Raise the head and torso to the upright position.  Exhale slightly to release the lock on the lungs and finally inhale slowly through the nose.  Remain in the standing position until the breath returns to normal before beginning the next round.           Uddiyana Bandha (abdominal contraction) Sit in siddha/siddha yoni asana or padmasana with the spine erect and the knees in contact with the floor. Place the palms of the hands flat on the knees. Close the eyes and relax the whole body. Inhale deeply through the nostrils. Exhale fully. Hold the breath outside. Lean forward and press down on the knees with the palms of the hands. Straighten the elbows and raise the shoulders, allowing further extension of the spinal cord. Practise jalandhara bandha, pressing the chin against the chest.  480 Contract the abdominal muscles inward and upward. Hold the abdominal lock and the breath outside for as long as you can without straining.  Then release the abdominal lock, bend the elbows and lower the shoulders.  Raise the head and then slowly inhale.  Remain in this position until the respiration returns to normal, then begin the next round.     Precaution: Uddiyana bandha is an advanced technique and should be attempted only under the guidance of a com- petent teacher. It should be practised after attaining proficiency in external breath retention, and jalandhara and moola bandhas.      Sequence: Uddiyana bandha is easier to perform if preceded by an inverted asana. It is ideally performed in conjunction with mudras, bandhas and pranayamas. If practised on its own, it should be performed after asanas and pranayamas and before meditation.   Duration: Practise 3 rounds in the beginning and gradually increase to 10 rounds over a few months as the system becomes accustomed to the practice.                                                                                                     ",Awareness: Physical —- on the abdomen and breath.  Spiritual — on manipura chakra.  ,Breathing: Uddiyana bandha is performed with external breath retention only.  ,"Benefits: Uddiyana bandha is a panacea for the abdomen. It stimulates the function of the pancreas and liver and strengthens the internal organs. The digestive fire is stimulated and the abdominal organs are massaged and toned. The adrenal glandsare balanced, removing lethargy and soothing anxiety and tension. It improves blood circulation throughout the torso.  Uddiyana bandha stimulates the solar plexus, which has  48] many subtle influences on the distribution of energy throughout the body. It creates a suction pressure which reverses the energy flow of apana and prana, uniting them with samana and stimulating manipura chakra.  Practice ","Contra-indications: Persons suffering from colitis, stomach or intestinal ulcer, diaphragmatic hernia, major abdominal problems, high blood pressure, heart disease, glaucoma and raised intracranial pressure should not perform this practice. It should also be avoided during pregnancy.  ",,,,,,
207,UJJAYI PRANAYAMA," note: Ujjayi may be performed in any position, stand- ing, sitting or lying. Those suffering from slipped disc or vertebral spondylitis may practise ujjayi in vajrasana or makarasana.  Relax the face as much as possible. Do not contract the throat too strongly. The contraction should be slight and applied continuously throughout the practice.  Technique note: Inner retention should be gradually increased as it helps in increasing introversion and concentration.  Advanced     2: with Antar Kumbhaka (inner retention) The inhalation and exhalation should be smooth and controlled. Inhale slowly and deeply through the nose. Retain the breath inside with awareness at ajna or bindu. The exhalation should be as long as is comfortable. Do not strain when performing kumbhaka; one or two seconds is sufficient at first. The duration may be increased gradually as the technique is mastered.   Extension: When this breathing has been mastered, fold the tongue back into khechari mudra (refer to the section Mudra).  If the tongue becomes tired, release it, while continuing the ujjayi breathing. When the tongue is rested, again fold it back.       practice: (addition of bandhas)  Before applying the bandhas in this practice, they should be perfected as individual practices. For details of these practices refer to the section Bandha.  Once antar kumbhaka has been mastered, bandhas may be incorporated.  Jalandhara  bandha: Inhale for a long, smooth breath. Practise jalandhara bandha with internal retention for a comfortable duration.  Release jalandhara and exhale. This is one round.  Jalandhara and moola  bandhas: Inhale. Practise jalandhara and then moola bandha, holding the breath inside for a comfortable duration.  Release moola bandha and then jalandhara and exhale. This is one round. Once the bandha can be held without strain, gradually build up the number of rounds.   Precaution: Do not practise pranayama with bandhas without the guidance of a competent teacher or guru.       Duration: Begin with 10 breaths and slowly increase to 5 minutes for general benefits.  As an adjunct to meditation or mantra repetition, practise for 10 to 20 minutes.   Note: The Sanskrit word ujjayi means ‘victorious’. It is derived from the root ji, which means ‘to conquer’ or ‘to acquire by conquest’, and the prefix ud, which means ‘bondage’. Ujjayt is therefore the pranayama which gives freedom from bondage. It is also known as the psychic breath, as it leads to subtle states of mind and is used together with khechari mudra, the tongue lock, in tantric meditation techniques such as mantra japa, ajapa japa, kriya yoga and prana vidya.  404                                                                                                       ",,,Benefits: Ujjayi is classified as a tranquillizing pranayama and it also has a heating effect on the body. This practice soothes the nervous system and calms the mind. It has a profoundly relaxing effect at the psychic level. It helps to relieve insomnia and may be practised in shavasana just before sleep. It slows down the heart rate and is useful for people suffering from high blood pressure.  Practice ,Contra-indications: People who are too introverted by nature should not perform this practice.  Contra-indications: Those suffering from heart disease should not combine bandhas or breath retention with ujjayi.  403 Practice Contra-indications: Those suffering from heart disease should not combine bandhas or breath retention with ujjayi.  ,,,,,,
208,UNMANI MUDRA,"                                             spine: ajna, vishuddhi, anahata, manipura, swadhisthana, mooladhara. The eyes should slowly close as the awareness descends. By the time the awareness reaches mooladhara, the eyes should be fully closed. Even when the eyes are open, the awareness is looking within. Do not try too hard, but allow the process to occur spontaneously. Inhale deeply and begin the next round. Continue for 5 to 10 minutes.                                                                           ",,,"Benefits: Unmani mudra calms stress and agitation, and induces a meditative state.  446 Note. The word unmani literally means ‘no mind’ or ‘not thinking’. It may also be translated as ‘the attitude of thoughtlessness’ or ‘meditation’. Unmani implies that state which is beyond thought, a state where all attachment to the world of objects is dispelled. In this state, the awareness functions without the hindrance of conflicting thoughts and analysis. This is known as unmani avastha, the state of no thought.

209,USHTRASANA,"   |: To begin with this asana may be practised with the balls of the feet on the floor.  Variation   2: To accentuate the asana, the right heel may be grasped with the left hand and the left heel with the right hand.  134               Sequence: It is important that this asana is followed by a forward bending asana, such as paschimottanasana, to release any tension in the back.

219,VAMAN DHAUTI," note: Plain water may be used on the advice of a competent teacher. Salt water, however, dissolves mucus and also inhibits the secretion of acid in the stomach, making it generally preferable, and a must for those suffering from excess mucus and hyperacidity.  The biggest obstacle to these techniques is the mental block which people have towards the idea of vomiting. Some people are unable to bring up the water at first. The water in the stomach will then simply pass through the system in the normal way.  The expelled water might be discoloured, especially on the first few attempts. This can be caused by fermented food particles, bile or mucus from the stomach. When the stomach is completely clean, the water will become clear. Gaja kriya is an advanced form of kunjal. In this practice, the water is expelled from the stomach by contracting the abdominal muscles. This action requires practice and good control over the muscles of the stomach.  510 Technique note: Vyaghra kriya is performed in the same way as kunjal kriya; however, it is done ona full or loaded stomach.  Note. Vyaghra means ‘tiger’. The tiger has the habit of gorging his stomach with his prey and then vomiting out the semi-digested food after three or four hours. This technique is a voluntary form of what the body does involuntarily if food is not digestible. The body will vomit as a last resort after trying unsuccessfully to digest the impure or excessive food that has been dumped into it. The easiest way to relieve heaviness, nausea and indigestion is to make the stomach expel the food through the mouth.  511    |: Kunjal Kriya (the practice of vomiting water) Stand near a sink or toilet, or if the weather is warm, in a suitable place outside in the garden or near an open drain. Drink at least 6 glasses of the prepared water, one after the other, as quickly as possible, until the stomach cannot hold any more. It is most important to drink fast and not just sip the water.  When the stomach is full, the urge to vomit will occur automatically.  Lean forward, keeping the trunk as horizontal as possible. Open the mouth and place the middle and index fingers of the right hand as far back on the tongue as possible.  Gently rub and press the back of the tongue.  508 This should induce the water to gush out from the stomach. If there is no expulsion of water, it means the tips of the fingers are not far enough down the throat or that the tongue is not being pressed.  The more the practitioner relaxes into the practice, the easier it will be.  During the expulsion of water the fingers may be removed from the mouth, although this is not necessary.  When the flow of water ceases, again place the fingers in the mouth and repeat the process.  Continue in this way until the stomach is empty.  Technique   2: Gaja Karma Kriya (elephant action) Drink at least 6 glasses of the prepared, warm, salted water. Fill the stomach with water unti] it will hold no more. Stand with the feet a comfortable distance apart, bend forward and place the hands on the knees. Relax the whole body. Open the mouth and breathe in slowly, making a whispering ‘ah’ sound from the deeper part of the throat. Simultaneously, contract the upper part of the abdomen just below the ribcage. At the end of inhalation, retain the compression of the abdomen and exhale. If this is performed correctly, the water should gush out of the mouth in a steady stream. It is important that the body remains relaxed during expulsion so that the water is not impeded.  Additional    3: Vyaghra Kriya (tiger practice)  While there is undigested or partially digested food in the stomach, drink at least 6 glasses of the prepared, warm, salted water.  Fill the stomach with water until it will hold no more. Expel the water in the same way as for kunjal kriya.  All the food in the stomach will be removed.     practice: Kunjal is best practised early in the morning before breakfast. However, if it is very cold, wait until the day has warmed up a little. It is essential that no food be taken before the practice.  practice: Vyaghra kriya may be practised three hours after eating food, whenever the stomach feels uncom- fortable. If the stomach has been severely overloaded or bad food has been taken, it may be performed earlier.     Precaution: When the vomiting reflex ceases to bring up any water, stop the technique as it is a sure sign that the stomach is empty. These techniques remove some of the stomach lining, leaving it temporarily vulnerable. For this reason, it is advised to eata light meal halfan hour after completion of the practice.                                    Preparation: Wash the hands and make sure the nails are carefully trimmed. Prepare about 2 litres of lukewarm (body temperature) water per person, adding 1 teaspoonful of salt per litre according to taste.  Technique               practices: Both techniques of kunjal should be followed by jala neti.  Time of                          Frequency: Kunjal may be performed once a week unless otherwise directed by a competent teacher.  509 Frequency: Vyaghra kriya should be performed only when necessary.  Practice                                ",,,"Benefits: These techniques tone and stimulate all the abdomi- nal organs by inducing strong muscular contractions in the stomach walls.

These techniques help to release pent-up emotions and emotional blocks or feelings of heaviness in the heartcaused by inner and external conflict and pressures.  Practice Benefits: This practice prevents burdening the intestines when either excessive amounts of food or rotten food has been eaten.  Although the modern remedy is to take indigestion tablets, the most natural and least harmful way to relieve the stomach is to vomit.

It also makes the leg muscles supple, strengthens the arms and tones the lower back.  319    Asana    Advanced Asanas  The advanced asana group should not be attempted unless the body is very flexible. The asanas in the beginners and intermediate groups must be mastered before trying to perform any of these postures. While practising the advanced asanas, it is essential to avoid overstraining the body in any way. These practices require the limbs and joints to move into unusual positions to which they are not habituated. Any strain may damage them. Gently coaxing the body to perform advanced asanas over a period of time is far better than trying to achieve quick results through force. The asanas are usually described with the right side leading, but this should be alternated.  Generally speaking, these asanas are designed to further improve the health of a person who is already very healthy. They are not designed for therapeutic purposes. They are not recommended during pregnancy. Carefully observe the contra- indications given for the individual asanas, and the asanas recommended as preparatory.  These asanas strongly affect the energy of the body. The chakras and associated physical, mental, emotional and psychic dimensions of the personality are stimulated and harmonized, contributing to positive transformations in one’s character.  323     ","Contra-indications: This asana should not be practised by people with hernia, high blood pressure, heart ailments, back conditions, vertigo or weakness of the limbs.

221,VASTRA DHAUTI," note: It may take some practice before being able to swallow the cloth. Remain relaxed, do not strain and the process will become easier. Do not hurry; just swallow the  514 cloth gently. Once the mind accepts the idea, the technique will soon be mastered.  After swallowing the cloth, the stomach should be massaged by the churning process of nauli, so that the cloth rubs and cleans the stomach walls.                practice: This practice should be performed in the morning before any food or drink are taken. The stomach must be completely empty before commencing.        Precautions: Do not talk while practising. Do not attempt this practice without the guidance of a competent teacher.   Sequence: It is necessary to become proficient in nauli before practising vastra dhauti.  Time of                               Preparation: A cloth is required for this practice, which should be clean and new. Finely woven, unstarched, undyed cotton such as white muslin is best. Synthetic material should be avoided. The fabric should be about 2% cm wide (no wider than the tongue or it will fold as it passes down the throat) and 3 metres long. After some months of practice, the width may be increased to 5 or 6 cm and the length to 6% metres. Any frayed edges or loose threads should be removed.  The cloth should be thoroughly washed and boiled in water before using. It should then be placed in a mug or bowl of lukewarm water. Salt may be added to the water, but is not essential. The water keeps the cloth wet so that it slips smoothly down the oesophagus into the stomach. The cloth may be soaked in warm milk or even sweetened milk, if this makes it easier to swallow.  The same cloth may be used several times. After the practice, boil it thoroughly in hot water as it will be thick with mucus. Dry it well, preferably in direct sunlight, and store it in a clean place.  512                                                         Ingestion: Squat comfortably, or sit on a low stool. Place the bow] containing the cloth on the ground between the feet. Relax the whole body. Take hold of one end of the cloth, leaving the other end immersed in the water. Fold the two corners of the end of the cloth so that it is slightly pointed; this will allow it to pass down the throat more easily. Place the pointed end as far back on the tongue as possible. Hold the remaining cloth outside the mouth with the index fingers and thumbs as shown in the diagram. Begin to swallow the cloth. If it catches in the throat, take a sip or two of warm water, but just a little, as the stomach is to be filled with the cloth and not with water. The jaws should move as though gently chewing the cloth, but do not actually chew it. This will induce copious secretions of saliva and enable the cloth to slip down with ease. The cloth may stick in the lowest part of the throat, causing a vomiting sensation to be experienced. Stop for a few moments until this passes and then continue swallowing. Once the cloth passes through the junction of the windpipe and the oesophagus, the problem will end and the cloth will slide smoothly into the stomach. Gradually feed more and more of the cloth into the mouth as the end slips down the oesophagus, but do not feed it too quickly or it will bunch up in the mouth and make the practice difficult. Do not swallow the whole cloth; allow at least 30 cm to protrude from the mouth.   Churning: Stand up. Practise dakshina (right) and vaman (left) nauli first, then perform rotations. Finally perform madhyama (middle) nauli. 3to5 minutes of naullis sufficient for cleaning the stomach. Beginners should only practise for one minute.  513 As an alternative to nauli, agnisara kriya may be practised. The cloth may be left in the stomach for 5 to 20 minutes, but no longer or it may start to enter the intestinal tract.  Removing the  cloth: The cloth must be slowly removed from the stomach.  Sit back in the squatting position once more.  Take hold of the cloth and pull it gently but firmly.  Do not pull too hard or it may damage the delicate walls of the stomach and oesophagus.  There may be some resistance to the withdrawal of the cloth at first, but this will pass after a few seconds and the cloth will come out easily.  Remove the whole cloth and let it fall into the mug or bowl.              ",,,"Benefits: The mucus from the chest is loosened and expelled, while the muscles of the bronchial tubes are relaxed,  improving respiratory functions.  Vastra dhauti induces strong reflexes in the throat and chest region. The practitioner has to wilfully control the urge to vomit which, as a result, tones the autonomic nervous system. One gains self confidence, willpower and a feeling of detachment from the body.  Practice ","Contra-indications: This practice should not be performed by people suffering from hypertension, heart disease, stroke, peptic ulcer, acute gastritis, during a time of general illness or when the body is in a weakened state.  It should not be practised until 6 months after any surgery, particularly abdominal surgery, or during pregnancy. ",,,,,,

Raise the buttocks and stand on the knees. Lean forward and place the hands flat on the floor beneath the shoulders with the fingers facing forward. The hands should be in line with the knees; the arms and thighs should be perpendicular to the floor. The knees may be slightly separated so that they are well aligned under the hips. This is the starting position. Inhale while raising the head and depressing the spine so that the back becomes concave. Expand the abdomen fully and fill the lungs with the maximum amount of air. Hold the breath for 3 seconds. Exhale while lowering the head and stretching the spine upward.  118 At the end of exhalation, contract the abdomen and pull in the buttocks.  The head will now be between the arms, facing the thighs. Hold the breath for 3 seconds, accentuating the arch of the spine and the abdominal contraction.  This is one round.  Benefits: This asana improves the flexibility of the neck, shoulders and spine. It gently tones the female repro- ductive system, giving relief from menstrual cramps and leucorrhea. It may be safely practised during pregnancy; forceful contraction of the abdomen, however, should be avoided.

227,VIPAREETA KARANI ASANA," note: This asana can be a preparatory practice for sarvangasana. It is highly recommended as it gives similar benefits to sarvangasana with less pressure on the neck. To begin with, it may be necessary to bend the knees when raising and lowering the legs.  Note. This posture provides the basis for vipareeta karani mudra.  258                    Duration: When first practising, hold for a few seconds only, gradually increasing the time over a period of months to an optimum of 3 to 5 minutes for general health purposes. This practice should be performed only once during the asana program.  Other                details: As for sarvangasana.

228,VIPAREETA KARANI MUDRA," note: The metabolic rate may increase when this mudra is practised for extended periods. If this happens, the food intake should be adjusted accordingly.  448           practice: Vipareeta karani mudra should be practised daily at the same time, preferably in the early morning.         Sequence: At the end of the daily practice program and before meditation. Do not perform after vigorous exercise or for at least 3 hours after meals. Upon completion of the practice, it is advisable to do a counterpose such as matsy- asana, bhujangasana or ushtrasana.  Time of  Duration: Practise up to 7 rounds at first, or until discomfort arises. If pressure builds up in the head, end the practice. Gradually increase the number of rounds up to 21 over a period of months. The length of the inhalation and exhalation will increase spontaneously over time, as the practice becomes more comfortable.   Note: The Sanskrit word vipareeta means ‘inverted’ and karani means ‘one who does’. Vipareeta karani mudra provides the basis for the kriya of the same name.

People suffering from high blood pressure, heart disease, enlarged thyroid or excessive toxins in the body should not perform this practice. Precautions for inverted postures apply.  ",,,,,,
229,VISHWAMITRASANA,"  position: A comfortable, sustainable meditation posture is necessary to enable efficient breathing and body steadiness during the practice. Siddha/siddha yoni asana or padmasana are the best postures for pranayama. The body should be as relaxed as possible throughout the practice with the spine, neck and head erect. Sit on a folded blanket or cloth of natural fibre to ensure the maximum conduction of energy during the practice. Those who cannot sit in a meditation posture may sit against a wall with the legs outstretched or in a chair which has a straight back.  Avoid          practice: The best time to practise pranayama is at dawn, when the body is fresh and the mind has very few impressions. If this is not possible, another good time is just after sunset. Tranquillizing pranayamas may be performed before sleep. Try to practise regularly at the same time and place each day. Regularity in practice increases strength and willpower as well as acclimatizing the body and mind to the increased pranic force. Do not be in a hurry; slow, steady progress is essential.  practice: Practise in a quiet, clean and pleasant room, which is well ventilated but not draughty. Generally, avoid practising in direct sunlight as the body will become over-heated, except at dawn when the soft rays of the early morning sun are beneficial. Practising in a draught or wind, in air-conditioning or under a fan may upset the body temper- ature and cause chills.         Sequence: Pranayama should be performed after shat- karmas and asanas, and before meditation practice. Nadi shodhana pranayama should be practised in each pranayama session as its balancing and purifying effects form the basis for successful pranayama. After practising pranayama, one may lie down in shavasana for a few minutes.  Sitting  Duration: One time on each side, holding the position for up to 30 seconds.                                     roots: ‘prana’ plus ‘ayama’. Prana means ‘vital energy’ or ‘life force’. It is the force which exists in all things, whether animate or inanimate. Although closely related to the air we breathe, it is more subtle than air or oxygen. Therefore, pranayama should not be considered as mere breathing exercises aimed at introducing extra oxygen into the lungs. Pranayama utilizes breathing to influence the flow of prana in the nadis or energy channels of the pranamaya kosha or energy body.  The word yama means ‘control’ and is used to denote various rules or codes of conduct. However, this is not the word which is joined to prana to form pranayama; the correct word is ‘ayama’ which has far more implications. Ayama is defined as ‘extension’ or ‘expansion’. Thus, the word pranayama means ‘extension or expansion of the dimension of prana’. The techniques of pranayama provide the method whereby the life force can be activated and regulated in order to go beyond one’s normal boundaries or limitations and attain a higher state of vibratory energy and awareness.  Four aspects of pranayama  In the pranayama practices there are four important aspects of breathing which are utilized. These      are:  1. Pooraka or inhalation  2. Rechaka or exhalation  369 3. Antar kumbhaka or internal breath retention 4. Bahir kumbhaka or external breath retention.  The different practices of pranayama involve various tech- niques which utilize these four aspects of breathing. There is another mode of pranayama, which is called kevala kumbhaka or spontaneous breath retention. This is an advanced stage of pranayama which occurs during high states of meditation. During this state, the fluctuation of prana ceases. At this time, the veil which prevents one from seeing the subtle aspect of existence is lifted and a higher vision of reality is attained.  The most important part of pranayama is actually kumbhaka or breath retention. However, in order to perform kumbhaka successfully, there must be a gradual development of control over the function of respiration. Therefore, in the pranayama practices more emphasis is given to inhalation and exhalation at the beginning, in order to strengthen the lungs and balance the nervous and pranic systems in preparation for the practice of kumbhaka. These initial practices influence the flow of prana in the nadis, purifying, regulating and activating them, thereby inducing physical and mental stability.  The pranic body  According to yogic physiology, the human framework is  comprised of five bodies or sheaths, which account for the  different aspects or dimensions of human existence. These  five sheaths are known                                     as:  . Annamaya kosha, the food or material body  . Manomaya kosha, the mental body  . Pranamaya kosha, the bioplasmic or vital energy body  . Vinanamaya kosha, the psychic or higher mental body  . Anandamaya kosha, the transcendental or bliss body. Although these five sheaths function together to form an  integral whole, the practices of pranayama work mainly with  pranamaya kosha. Pranamaya kosha is made up of five major  pranas, which are collectively known as the pancha, or five,              faktrarera: t WRakSarfor Woraayaasaay 02:2  Athaasane dridhe yogee vashee hitamitaashanaha. Guroopadishtamaargena praanaayaamaansamabhyset.  Thus being established in asana and having control (of the body), taking a balanced diet; pranayamas should be practised according to the instructions of the guru.  Hatha Yoga Pradipika (2:1)       Introduction to Pranayama  pawn is generally defined as breath control. Although this interpretation may seem correct in view of the practices involved, it does not convey the full meaning of the term. The word pranayama is comprised of two  pranas: prana, apana, samana, udana and vyana.  ovo oo po  370 The Pranic Body     apana  /N__ vyana (pervades 4 the whole body)        UM)  Prana in this context does not refer to cosmic prana, but rather to just one flow of energy, governing the thoracic area between the larynx and the top of the diaphragm. It is associated with the heart and organs of respiration together with the muscles and nerves that activate them. It is the force by which the breath is drawn inside.  Apana governs the abdomen, below the navel region, and provides energy for the large intestine, kidneys, anus and genitals. It is concerned with the expulsion of waste from the body and is the force which expels the breath.  37] Samana is located between the heart and the navel. It activates and controls the digestive  system: the liver, intestines, pancreas and stomach, and their secretions. Samana is res- ponsible for transformation. On a physical level this relates to the assimilation and distribution of nutrients. On an evolutionary level it relates to kundalini and expansion of consciousness.  Udana governs the neck and head, activating all the sensory receptors such as the eyes, tongue, nose and ears. Udana also harmonizes and activates the limbs and all their associated muscles, ligaments, nerves and joints. It is responsible for the erect posture of the body, sensory awareness, and the ability to respond to the outside world.  Vyana pervades the whole body, regulating and controlling all movement, and coordinating the other pranas. It acts as the reserve force for the other pranas.  Along with these five major pranas there are five minor pranas known as the  upa-pranas: naga, koorma, krikara, devadatta and dhananjaya. Naga is responsible for belching and hiccups. Koorma opens the eyes and stimulates blinking. Krikara generates hunger, thirst, sneezing and coughing. Devadatta induces sleep and yawning. Dhananjaya lingers after death and upon its departure, decay and decomposition of the body begins to happen.  Prana and lifestyle  Lifestyle has a profound impact on the pranamaya kosha and its pranas. Physical activities such as exercise, work, sleep, intake of food and sexual relations all affect the distribution and flow of prana in the body. Faculties of the mind such as emotion, thought and imagination affect the pranic body even more. Irregularities in lifestyle, dietary indiscretions and stress deplete and obstruct the pranic flow. This results in what people experience as being ‘drained of energy’. Depletion of energy ina particular prana leads to the devitalization of the organs and limbs it governs and ultimately to disease or metabolic dysfunction. The techniques of pranayama reverse this process, energizing and balancing the different pranas  372 within pranamaya kosha. Pranayama practices should be performed after asanas in an integrated yoga program.  Breath, health and pranayama  The breath is the most vital process of the body. It influences the activities of each and every cell and, most importantly, is intimately linked with the performance of the brain. Human beings breathe about 15 times per minute and 21,600 times per day. Respiration fuels the burning of oxygen and glucose, producing energy to power every muscular contraction, glan- dular secretion and mental process. The breath is intimately linked to all aspects of human experience.  Most people breathe incorrectly, using only a small part of their lung capacity. The breathing is then generally shallow, depriving the body of oxygen and prana essential to its good health. The first five practices given in this section are preparatory techniques which introduce correct breathing habits. In addition, they help focus the awareness on the breathing process, which is otherwise normally ignored. Practitioners develop sensitivity to the respiratory process and retrain the muscles of the pulmonary cavity, enhancing their vital capacity and preparing them for pranayama.  Rhythmic, deep and slow respiration stimulates and is stimulated by calm, content, states of mind. Irregular breathing disrupts the rhythms of the brain and leads to physical, emotional and mental blocks. These, in turn, lead to inner conflict, an unbalanced personality, a disordered lifestyle and disease. Pranayama establishes regular breathing patterns, breaking this negative cycle and reversing the debilitating process. It does so by giving us control of the breath and re- establishing the natural, relaxed rhythms of the body and mind.  Although breathing is mainly an unconscious process, conscious control of it may be taken at any time. Consequently, it forms a bridge between the conscious and unconscious areas of the mind. Through the practice of pranayama, the energy trapped in neurotic, unconscious mental patterns may be released for use in more creative and joyful activity.  373 Breathing and life span  In addition to influencing the quality of life, the length or quantity of life is also dictated by the rhythm of the respiration. The ancient yogis and rishis studied nature in great detail. They noticed that animals with a slow breath rate such as pythons, elephants and tortoises have long life spans, whereas those with a fast breathing rate such as birds, dogs and rabbits live for only a few years. From this observation they realized the importance of slow breathing for increasing the human lifespan. Those who breathe in short, quick gasps are likely to have a shorter life span than those who breathe slowly and deeply. On the physical level, this is because the respiration is directly related to the heart. A slow breathing rate keeps the heart stronger and betternourished and contributes to a longer life. Deep breathing also increases the absorption of energy by pranamaya kosha, enhancing dynamism, vitality and general well-being.  Pranayama and the spiritual aspirant  Pranayama practices establish a healthy body by removing blockages in the pranamaya kosha, enabling increased absorption and retention of prana. The spiritual seeker requires tranquillity of mind as an essential prelude to spiritual practice. To this end, many pranayama techniques utilize kumbhaka, breath retention, to establish control over the flow of prana, calming the mind and controlling the thought process.  Once the mind has been stilled and prana flows freely in the nadis and chakras, the doorway to the evolution of con- sciousness opens, leading the aspirant into higher dimensions of spiritual experience. In The Science of Pranayama, Swami Sivananda writes, “There is an intimate connection between the breath, nerve currents and control of the inner prana or vital forces. Prana becomes visible on the physical plane as motion and action, and on the mental plane as thought. Pranayama is the means by which a yogi tries to realize within his individual body the whole cosmic nature, and at- tempts to attain perfection by attaining all the powers of the universe.”  374 General notes for the practitioner  In the traditional texts, there are innumerable rules and regulations pertaining to pranayama. The main points are to exercise moderation, balance and common sense with regard to inner and outer thinking and living. However, for those who seriously wish to take up the advanced practices of pranayama, the guidance of a guru or competent teacher is essential.   Bathing: Take a bath or shower before commencing the practice, or at least wash the hands, face and feet. Do not take a bath for at least half an hour after the practice to allow the body temperature to normalize.   Clothes: Loose, comfortable clothing made of natural fibres should be worn during the practice. The body may be covered with a sheet or blanket when it is cold or to keep insects away.  Empty  stomach: Practise before eating in the morning or wait at least three to four hours after meals before starting pranayama. Food in the stomach places pressure on the diaphragm and lungs, making full, deep respiration difficult.   Diet: A balanced diet of protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals is suitable for most pranayama practices. A combination of grains, pulses, fresh fruit and vegetables, with some milk products if necessary, is recommended.  When commencing pranayama practice, constipation and a reduction in the quantity of urine may be experienced. In the  375 case of dry motions, stop taking salt and spices, and drink plenty of water. In the case of loose motions, stop the practices for a few days and go on a diet of rice and curd or yoghurt.  The more advanced stages of pranayama require a change in diet and a guru should be consulted for guidance on this.  Place of  strain: With all pranayama practices, it is important to remember that the instruction not to strain, not to try to increase your capacity too fast, applies just as it does to asana practice. If one is advised to practise a pranayama technique  376 until it is mastered, and it can be practised without any strain or dicomfort, it is wise to follow that instructionbefore moving on to a more advanced practice or ratio. Furthermore, breath retention should only be practised for as long as is comfortable. The lungs are very delicate organs and any misuse can easily cause them injury. Not only the physical body, but also the mental and emotional aspects of the personality need time to adjust. Never strain in any way.  Side  effects: Various symptoms may manifest in normally healthy people. These are caused by the process of purification and the expulsion of toxins. Sensations of itching, tingling, heat or cold, and feelings of lightness or heaviness may occur. Such experiences are generally temporary, but if they persist, check with a competent teacher. Energy levels may increase or fluctuate; interests may change. Ifsuchchangescause difficulty in lifestyle, decrease or stop the practice until a competent teacher or guru gives guidance.  377 NATURAL BREATHING  This is a simple technique which introduces practitioners to their own respiratory system and breathing patterns. It is very relaxing and may be practised at any time. Awareness of the breathing process is itself sufficient to slow down the respiratory rate and establish a more relaxed rhythm.  Natural breathing Sit in a comfortable meditation posture or lie in shavasana and relax the whole body. Observe the natural and spontaneous breathing process. Develop total awareness of the rhythmic flow of the breath. Feel the breath flowing in and out of the nose. Do not control the breath in any way. Notice that the breath is cool as it enters the nostrils and warm as it flows out. Observe this with the attitude of a detached witness. Feel the breath flowing in and out at the back of the mouth above the throat. Bring the awareness down to the region of the throat and feel the breath flowing in the throat. Bring the awareness down to the region of the chest and feel the breath flowing in the trachea and bronchial tubes. Next, feel the breath flowing in the lungs. Be aware of the lungs expanding and relaxing. Shift the attention to the ribcage and observe the expansion and relaxation of this area. Bring the awareness down to the abdomen. Feel the abdomen move upward on inhalation and downward on exhalation. Finally, become aware of the whole breathing process from the nostrils to the abdomen and continue observing it for some time. Bring the awareness back to observing the physical body as one unit and open the eyes.  378       ",Awareness: Physical — on maintaining balance.  Spiritual — on mooladhara chakra.  ,"Breathing: Inhale as the arm moves up.  Exhale as the arm comes down.  Breathing: Always breathe through the nose and not the mouth unless specifically instructed otherwise. Both nostrils must be clear and flowing freely. Mucous blockages may be removed through the practice of neti or kapalbhati. If the flow of breath in the nostrils is unequal, it may be balanced by practising padadhirasana as a breath balancing technique.  ","Benefits: This asana stretches and tones the muscles of the arms and legs, and the sciatic nerves. It strengthens the internal organs, improves concentration and the sense of balance.  Note. Sage Vishwamitra was originally a kshatriya, a member of the warrior class, and the king of Kanyakubja. He devoted himself to the most rigorous yogic austerities until he successfully achieved the titles of rajarishi, royal sage, rishi, sage or seer, maharishi, great sage or patriarch of mankind, and finally brahmarishi, brahmanical sage. This asana is dedicated to him.  366 Pranayama               STAR FS Brit agit ","Contra-indications: Pranayama should not be practised during illness, although simple techniques such as breath awareness and abdominal breathing in shavasana may be performed.

236,YONI MUDRA,"                    Note: The word yoni means ‘womb’ or ‘source’. Yoni mudra invokes the primal energy inherent in the womb or source of creation.  428   Variation: Yoni mudra may also be performed by interlocking the middle, ring and little fingers without turning them inward. The thumbs may be crossed in front of the out- stretched index fingers, or outstretched with the pads touching towards the body.                                                                                                   ",,,"Benefits: The interlocking of the fingers in this practice creates a complete cross-connection of energies from the right hand into the left and vice versa. As well as balancing the energies in the body, it helps to balance the activities of the right and left hemispheres of the brain. Placing the tips of the index fingers and thumbs together further intensifies the flow of prana.  This mudra makes the body and mind more stable in meditation and develops greater concentration, awareness and internal physical relaxation.  It redirects prana back into the body which would otherwise be dispersed through the hands and fingers. The elbows naturally tend to point to the side when performing this mudra which helps open up the chest area.  ",,,,,,,
